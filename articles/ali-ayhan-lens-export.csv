F. Nied,"The application of enriched crack tip finite elements for the prediction of interface fracture parameters, e.g., strain energy release rate and mixed mode stress intensity factors, is presented. Of particular interest, is the comparison between fracture results obtained from two-dimensional (2-D) models and related three-dimensional (3-D) (generalized plane strain) calculations. These results show that for thermal cycling problems, one cannot anticipate 3-D fracture results based on 2-D calculations alone, i.e., plane stress, plane strain, and axisymmetric models. On the other hand, it is shown that the 2-D models are quite adequate for modeling interface fracture in the case of pressure loading on the interface, e.g., pressure due to water vapor expansion during solder reflow. The fracture results presented in this paper were obtained using special enriched crack tip elements that contain the analytic asymptotic displacement and stress field. Enriched crack tip elements for 2-D and 3-D elements are shown to provide highly accurate results for simulating debonding in semiconductor packages subjected to thermal cycling and/or moisture absorption.",22,4,503,511,Composite material; Temperature cycling; Materials science; Stress field; Plane stress; Strain energy release rate; Fracture (geology); Stress intensity factor; Fracture mechanics; Structural engineering; Fracture toughness,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/814965/ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=814965,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/6144.814965,,10.1109/6144.814965,2165494587,,0,005-810-246-442-682; 027-872-289-338-043; 035-342-865-119-52X; 047-980-140-341-993; 099-507-346-713-070,20,false,,

In Part 1 of the study, results from numerical and experimental analyses are given. Having computed the mixed mode stress intensity factors from the numerical analyses, fracture loads are predicted and compared with different mixed mode-I/II fracture criteria. The experimental and numerical results show that many criteria are in good agreement with each other for predominately mode I to moderate mixed mode conditions.

In this study, a tetrahedral enriched element method and related applications are presented that demonstrate employment of fully unstructured tetrahedral meshes for general mixed-mode three-dimensional fracture problems. As in the case of hexahedral enriched elements, the tetrahedral enriched elements also alleviate the needs of pre- and post-processing the finite element model, allowing direct computation of stress intensity factors in the solution phase. In addition, when tetrahedral enriched elements are used, the crack front region can also be meshed using unstructured elements allowing direct use of automatic free-meshing programs. The applications presented are plane-strain central crack problem, mode-I surface crack in a plate, inclined penny-shaped crack, edge-cracked bar under constant heat flux and lens-shaped crack embedded in a large elastic body. The results obtained are in good comparative agreement with those available in the literature. Thus, it is concluded that the enriched tetrahedral elements can be applied efficiently and accurately on a general three-dimensional fracture problem allowing usage of fully unstructured finite element meshes.",48,3,492,505,Tetrahedron; Engineering; Finite element method; Mesh generation; Engineering drawing; Hexahedron; Plane stress; Polygon mesh; Fracture (geology); Computational science; Stress intensity factor,,,,The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK),https://www.tpbin.com/Uploads/Subjects/774c2751-ae49-47c3-9841-b541ce7d6424.pdf http://www.tpbin.com/Uploads/Subjects/774c2751-ae49-47c3-9841-b541ce7d6424.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768310003665 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768310003665,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2010.10.012,,10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2010.10.012,2009878351,,0,001-765-533-995-743; 002-153-120-561-698; 002-237-036-082-879; 003-888-995-542-362; 004-556-970-090-203; 007-870-299-274-35X; 009-174-834-769-148; 009-887-067-921-478; 010-122-739-575-258; 011-248-740-727-298; 011-559-963-664-093; 013-446-936-859-583; 014-820-503-874-124; 015-032-671-610-32X; 017-146-570-454-151; 017-759-478-710-505; 018-639-244-863-680; 019-002-309-246-922; 019-170-410-478-405; 019-576-571-059-973; 023-122-700-075-055; 028-247-818-575-179; 031-803-320-907-394; 032-827-595-908-655; 035-253-896-495-97X; 037-020-296-091-029; 037-923-841-897-325; 039-960-813-699-749; 042-497-786-442-599; 052-625-232-127-446; 054-228-126-521-793; 056-980-833-333-992; 062-946-463-932-67X; 067-150-629-919-730; 080-110-541-858-667; 080-870-481-449-360; 080-980-234-081-105; 082-320-507-210-013; 088-431-181-876-156; 089-481-645-190-198; 090-491-198-678-128; 091-947-272-534-608; 094-291-296-999-549; 105-337-585-184-643; 108-803-310-858-922; 109-794-278-046-469; 111-768-176-948-050; 113-410-457-537-14X; 113-951-745-942-889; 117-257-722-604-591; 121-632-237-941-574; 125-900-764-135-105; 134-088-491-329-853; 134-183-713-301-510; 137-889-990-750-721; 140-499-144-907-253; 160-626-713-953-984; 162-943-128-321-97X; 184-824-780-234-574,16,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

Management of these patients can differ from that of patients with uniform tumours. We present a case of synchronous epithelial ovarian cancer and malignant mixed Mullerian tumour in different ovaries, its follow-up and management until death. To our knowledge this is the second case in the English literature to date. A 61-year-old woman with bilateral adnexal masses underwent complete debulking surgery for ovarian cancer. The final pathology was reported as malignant mixed Mullerian tumour in the right ovary with intact borders and stage 2 grade 3 serous carcinoma in the left ovary. She had a 17-month disease-free interval after 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Recurrence of malignant mixed Mullerian tumour was reported in the pathology after secondary debulking including a partial ileal resection. After 6 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin she had a widespread recurrence in the thorax and abdomen. The patient died of disease recurrence at the 25th month after diagnosis. Coexistence of serous and malignant mixed Mullerian tumour in different ovaries is very rare. The main treatment is complete cytoreduction followed with chemotherapy. Platinum-taxane based chemotherapy resulted in an acceptable disease-free interval in our case, but it is not standard yet.

Materials and Methods One hundred forty-four endometrial cancer survivors who were treated between January 2000 and December 2009 in our department were included in this study. Median follow-up was 79 months (range, 31–138 months). Fifty-two patients were treated with 45 to 50.4 Gy EBRT, 76 were with BRT, and 16 were with both EBRT and BRT. Brachytherapy was in the form of vaginal cuff BRT with 5 × 550 cGy high dose rate BRT, prescribed to the first 4 cm and whole wall thickness of vagina. Quality of life was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and subscales from the supplemental 24-item Cervical Cancer Module. Results Vaginal BRT patients reported better physical functioning (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.03), and sexual enjoyment (P = 0.01) compared to EBRT group. Symptom score (P = 0.01), lymphedema (P = 0.03), pain (P = 0.02), and diarrhea (P = 0.009) scores were also higher with EBRT. Vaginal BRT did not worsen symptom scores or sexual functions when added to EBRT. Obese patients experienced higher rates of lymphedema (P = 0.008). Cognitive and role functioning scores were significantly higher in patients with normal body mass index. Conclusions External beam radiotherapy negatively affects long-term QOL and sexual functions in endometrial cancer survivors. Vaginal BRT provides higher QOL.

Material and methods Cervical cancer patients operated in the gynecologic oncology division between 2007 and 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. One-hundred and sixty-eight patients with tumor size ≤4 cm were identified. Of these, 159 (86.8%) underwent radical hysterectomy plus pelvic-para-aortic lymphadenectomy and nine (13.2%) underwent fertility-sparing surgery [radical trachelectomy (n=7); large conization (n=2)]. Factors affecting parametrial invasion, including lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), deep stromal invasion (DSI), lymph node metastases, and tumor size, were evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results Median age was 49.5 years and median tumor size was 2.5 cm (0.45-4 cm). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the risk of parametrial involvement was increased with LVSI with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.45 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-10.8] and DSI with a HR of 4.1 (95% CI: 1.18-14.8), while tumor size of ≤2 cm was only significant in univariate analyses. Furthermore, 26 early-stage patients were identified with low-risk factors and they had no parametrial involvement, lymph node metastases, recurrence, or death from disease over 77 months.

Methods This retrospective case-control study was carried out at the Baskent University in Ankara between 2007 and 2017. We reviewed 62 patients with advanced stage (IIIC-IV) EOC who received NACT in other institutes and operated in our clinic. On the basis of the number of NACT cycles, patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 received 3 cycles and group 2 received 4 to 6 cycles.The influence of the number of NACT cycles on complete pathologic response, lymph node involvement, overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), platinum resistance and residual tumor were evaluated. Results The median OS was 44.4 ±4.8 months and 48.8±4.49 months for group 1 and group 2 respectively (p=0.122). PFS was 19.3±3.75 months in group 1 and 24.3±4.67 months in group 2 (p=0.84). Tumor morphology according to lymph node involvement, no visible tumor and complete pathologic response were similar for both groups (p=0.49, p=0.79 and p=0.6 respectively). Pathological absence of residual disease were 13.6% vs 7.5% for group 1 and group 2 respectively (p=0.6) and total response rate was 6/62 (9.67%). Platinum resistance developed in 4 (18.2%) patients and 18(45%) patients in group1 and 2 respectively (p=0.031). Complete resection rates were similar for both groups (p=0.9). After multivariate survival analyses, complete resection remained significant (p=0.000, odds ratio/OR 2.28 [1.41-3.70]), and was independent of age, platinum resistance and number of NACT cycles. Complete resection rates were almost equal in each groups, (68.2% [15/22] and 67.5% [27/40] for group 1 and group 2 respectively (p=0.9)). Conclusions Our data suggests that giving more than 3 cycles of NACT is unnecessary because increased number of cycles did not change the resectability and complete pathologic response, while it increased platinum resistance.

Lee; Sandro Pignata,"Abstract Background While early stage endometrial cancer (EC) is associated with a favorable prognosis, prognosis for advanced or recurrent EC is poor. Paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy (CT) is often used as first-line treatment for these patients; however, there exists an imperative need for more effective and tolerable therapies. In KEYNOTE-146, combination therapy with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (pembro) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib resulted in an ORR of 39% in patients with EC (Makker et al. ASCO 2018). Based on these promising data, the ENGOT-EN9/LEAP-001 study was initiated to assess this combination therapy in women with recurrent or advanced EC. Trial design The ENGOT-EN9/LEAP-001 study (NCT03884101) is a phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial comparing combination therapy with pembro and lenvatinib to paclitaxel and carboplatin CT in patients with newly diagnosed stage III-IV or recurrent EC (NCT03884101). Approximately 720 patients not previously treated with systemic chemotherapy (except as part of a chemoradiation regimen), antiangiogenic agents, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors, or other T-cell receptor–targeted agents will be randomized 1:1 to pembro (200 mg Q3W) plus lenvatinib (20 mg daily) or paclitaxel and carboplatin CT (pac 175 mg/m2 plus carb AUC 6 Q3W). Patients will first be stratified by proficient vs deficient mismatch repair status (pMMR vs dMMR), and pMMR patients will be further stratified by ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), measurable disease (yes vs no), and prior chemoradiation (yes vs no). Treatment will continue until disease progression, initiation of new anticancer treatment, unacceptable adverse events, or withdrawal of consent for up to 35 cycles for pembro or 7 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin CT. Primary endpoints are PFS per RECIST v1.1, assessed by blinded independent central review, and OS. Secondary endpoints are ORR, health-related quality of life, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib. Exploratory endpoints include duration of response, disease control rate, and clinical benefit rate. Enrollment is ongoing. Clinical trial identification NCT03884101; 21, 2019.

Yaren; Ali Ayhan; Sedat Iriç,"Abstract In this study, validities of different crack growth retardation models existing in the literature are evaluated by performing fatigue crack growth experiments. Compact tension specimens made from rolled Al-7075 plates with L-T crack orientation are used. In the experimental analyses, by keeping the minimum alternating load at a constant value, the magnitudes of the overloads are changed systematically and the crack growth behavior is monitored for each test. For the same conditions, crack growth predictions with retardation effects are made by employing the existing retardation models in the literature and they are compared with the experimental measurements. The results show that the higher the magnitude of the overload, the higher the retardation effect. It is also observed that except two models, all retardation models predict the retarded crack growth behavior with a reasonable closeness to experimental measurements.",21,,31,37,Composite material; Materials science; Tension (physics); Retardation effect; Growth retardation; Paris' law,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452321619305578,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prostr.2019.12.083,,10.1016/j.prostr.2019.12.083,3000714529,,0,070-609-741-904-525; 077-454-442-097-226; 079-576-868-153-203; 084-180-456-432-425; 123-179-061-040-691; 158-022-840-866-964; 160-676-942-517-858,1,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

The treatment of endometrial cancer is rapidly evolving. Areas covered in this review: In this article, we aim to review current and future treatment options in the medical treatment of endometrial cancers. What the reader will gain: The cornerstone of curative therapy for patients with endometrial cancer is surgical treatment. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is the mainstay of therapy for metastatic and advanced endometrial cancer. The most active chemotherapy agents are anthracyclines, platinum compounds and taxanes. Combination chemotherapy has produced higher response rates than single agent therapy. Cisplatin and doxorubicin combination chemotherapy has served as the control arm in many trials. Three-drug combination regimen has shown the highest response rate but with increased toxicity.

Little is known about their effects on left ventricular mechanical and coronary microvascular functions.; ; Methods; Thirty consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled. Patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) before and after chemotherapy, to evaluate left ventricular mechanical functions and coronary flow reserve (CFR). A comprehensive TTE, tissue Doppler and two-dimensional (2D) strain imaging were performed and coronary flow velocity was measured at baseline and after dipyridamole infusion. CFR was calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to baseline diastolic peak flow velocities. Mitral annular velocities by tissue Doppler, peak strain, and systolic strain rate by velocity vector imaging (VVI) were measured. Baseline measurements were compared with healthy controls (n = 26).; ; Results; No patient developed heart failure (HF) symptoms, no significant change occurred in left ventricular ejection fraction or cardiac output and no significant difference was observed in CFR after chemotherapy. Baseline mean longitudinal peak strain and systolic stain rate were similar between patients and controls: −17.5 ± 2.6% versus −17.6 ± 2.2% (P = NS) and −1.04 ± 0.14/sec versus −1.05 ± 0.12/sec (P = NS). Peak strain and systolic strain rate decreased significantly after chemotherapy (from −17.5 ± 2.6% to −16.2 ± 2.5%, P < 0.02; and from −1.05 ± 0.12/sec to −0.96 ± 0.11/sec, P = 0.01, respectively). However, mean longitudinal velocity did not change significantly.; ; Conclusion; Paclitaxel and carboplatin combination did not impair CFR; however, this chemotherapy combination could induce subtle impairment in myocardial mechanical function which can be detected by advanced deformation imaging techniques rather than by tissue Doppler imaging or conventional 2D and Doppler echocardiography.",32,2,238,247,Doppler imaging; Internal medicine; Cardiac output; Cardiology; Dipyridamole; Heart failure; Coronary flow reserve; Doppler echocardiography; Diastole; Medicine; Ejection fraction,cardiac toxicity; coronary flow reserve; strain-strain rate,"Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology; Blood Flow Velocity/drug effects; Carboplatin/pharmacology; Coronary Circulation/drug effects; Drug Therapy, Combination; Echocardiography, Doppler; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female/drug therapy; Heart Ventricles/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Microvessels/diagnostic imaging; Middle Aged; Paclitaxel/pharmacology; Prospective Studies; Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects",Antineoplastic Agents; Carboplatin; Paclitaxel,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24814007 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24814007 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814007/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/echo.12621,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/echo.12621,24814007,10.1111/echo.12621,2143982085,,0,000-021-536-032-848; 000-032-742-203-955; 004-020-833-912-869; 004-328-817-814-741; 004-894-664-601-812; 006-250-181-416-398; 007-348-176-324-204; 009-345-356-109-332; 010-797-295-354-870; 011-438-684-793-617; 014-609-092-284-731; 014-862-635-046-086; 015-577-294-066-495; 016-135-187-753-060; 017-956-123-975-400; 021-307-422-680-527; 021-556-814-680-03X; 024-039-444-798-746; 024-087-698-424-409; 035-700-895-963-964; 035-716-730-974-485; 037-586-210-377-871; 041-881-951-429-372; 042-888-102-503-265; 044-145-955-507-685; 044-565-943-758-146; 044-700-182-622-955; 049-011-587-202-658; 050-396-349-397-82X; 056-959-412-613-084; 058-163-803-030-90X; 063-056-644-002-57X; 064-144-317-896-971; 065-580-673-706-377; 066-451-077-957-503; 082-915-319-279-729; 086-758-150-941-746; 089-460-183-156-282; 091-371-667-051-038; 121-555-325-282-410; 122-293-069-304-244,10,false,,

This cross-sectional study compared a group of women who underwent a hysterectomy (n = 100) with a healthy control group (n = 100). The study findings indicate that women who had a hysterectomy were found in worse conditions in terms of body image, self-esteem, and dyadic adjustment compared to healthy women. In terms of dyadic adjustment and body image among women who had undergone a hysterectomy, those with lower levels of income and education were found in poorer conditions. The study's findings show that hysterectomies have negative effects on body image, self-esteem, and dyadic adjustment in women affected by gynecologic cancer.

Methods A total of 625 consecutive women who underwent comprehensive surgical staging for endometrioid EC clinically confined to the uterus were divided into low- and high-risk groups according to the GOG-99, the Mayo-modified, and the ESMO-modified criteria. Lymphovascular space invasion is the cornerstone of risk stratification according to the ESMO-modified criteria. These 3 risk stratification models were compared in terms of predicting LN positivity. Results Systematic LN dissection was achieved in all patients included in the study. LN involvement was detected in 70 (11.2%) patients. LN involvement was correctly estimated in 51 of 70 LN-positive patients according to the GOG-99 criteria (positive likelihood ratio [LR+], 3.3; negative likelihood ratio [LR-], 0.4), 64 of 70 LN-positive patients according to the ESMO-modified criteria (LR+, 2.5; LR-, 0.13) and 69 of the 70 LN-positive patients according to the Mayo-modified criteria (LR+, 2.2; LR-, 0.03). The area under curve of the Mayo-modified, the GOG-99 and the ESMO-modified criteria was 0.763, 0.753, and 0.780, respectively. Conclusion The ESMO-modified classification seems to be the risk-stratification model that most accurately predicts LN involvement in endometrioid EC clinically confined to the uterus. However, the Mayo-modified classification may be an alternative model to achieve a precise balance between the desire to prevent over-treatment and the ability to diagnose LN involvement.",28,6,0,,Dissection; Internal medicine; Oncology; Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing; Endometrial cancer; Carcinoma; Metastasis; Uterus; Gynecologic oncology; Lymph node; Medicine,Carcinoma  Endometrioid; Endometrial Neoplasms; Lymph Node; Metastasis,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Endometrioid/pathology; Endometrial Neoplasms/pathology; Female; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment/methods",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641528 https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2017.28.e78 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29027396 https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2017.28.e78 https://ejgo.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/1114JGO/jgo-28-e78.pdf http://dspace.baskent.edu.tr/handle/11727/3362 https://ejgo.org/search.php?where=aview&id=10.3802/jgo.2017.28.e78&code=1114JGO&vmode=FULL http://acikerisim.baskent.edu.tr/handle/11727/3362 https://synapse.koreamed.org/upload/SynapseData/PDFData/1114jgo/jgo-28-e78.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29027396/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2017.28.e78,29027396,10.3802/jgo.2017.28.e78,2753863545,PMC5641528,0,000-876-938-761-270; 001-478-902-508-567; 002-309-306-379-892; 002-547-248-351-122; 004-834-859-379-962; 008-724-229-320-366; 011-024-502-430-699; 015-587-095-520-551; 020-742-166-984-723; 022-464-792-177-027; 027-622-469-810-702; 035-223-072-394-52X; 042-397-094-494-357; 046-959-715-391-789; 048-013-354-173-836; 051-172-134-689-212; 051-805-014-220-820; 052-055-332-951-123; 052-740-209-607-824; 055-705-378-714-001; 056-764-954-025-965; 058-184-282-111-984; 059-243-756-711-062; 062-979-553-076-492; 064-211-574-682-066; 064-473-822-351-662; 077-252-623-743-21X; 078-263-383-320-356; 085-550-641-151-213; 089-937-230-715-143; 109-677-274-309-847; 124-678-289-264-889; 158-796-077-296-644; 165-533-493-110-721; 165-779-363-158-444,31,true,cc-by-nc,gold

DESIGN A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted during a 6-month period to examine the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on blood coagulation parameters. One hundred-ten healthy postmenopausal women were randomized into two groups. Those in group 1 were given conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg/d, Premarin) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (5 mg/d, Farlutal), and those in group 2 were given identical tablets of placebo for 6 months. Serum levels of modified activated protein C resistance, antithrombin III, fibrinogen, factor VIIIa, factor VIII, factor IX, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, and lipoprotein (a) were measured before and 6 months after the treatment and analyzed for changes in extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation parameters. RESULTS At the end of the 6-month period, fibrinogen, lipoprotein (a), and activated protein C resistance levels were decreased significantly in the HRT group compared with the control group. Antithrombin III levels were increased, indicating antithrombin activity. Activated partial thromboplastin time, as a measure for intrinsic coagulation cascade, was prolonged in concert with decreased intrinsic coagulation factors, factor VIII, and factor IX (p 0.05). CONCLUSION Significant changes were observed in the coagulation parameters, which may further explain the cardioprotective effect of HRT.",8,2,135,140,Internal medicine; Endocrinology; Partial thromboplastin time; Coagulation; Antithrombin; Fibrinogen; Activated protein C resistance; Thrombin time; Prothrombin time; Factor IX; Medicine,,Activated Protein C Resistance; Adult; Antithrombin III/analysis; Blood Coagulation Factors/analysis; Double-Blind Method; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Factor IX/analysis; Factor VIII/analysis; Female; Fibrinogen/analysis; Hemostasis/drug effects; Humans; Lipoprotein(a)/blood; Medroxyprogesterone Acetate/administration & dosage; Middle Aged; Partial Thromboplastin Time; Placebos; Prothrombin Time,Blood Coagulation Factors; Lipoprotein(a); Placebos; Antithrombin III; Factor VIII; Factor IX; Fibrinogen; Medroxyprogesterone Acetate,,https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/11256874 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11256874,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00042192-200103000-00009,11256874,10.1097/00042192-200103000-00009,1988101250,,0,000-009-527-431-554; 000-588-903-896-064; 000-745-830-888-771; 004-981-421-010-554; 007-651-872-346-759; 007-845-084-478-123; 009-524-221-615-864; 011-275-359-434-051; 013-234-941-356-441; 013-305-302-303-891; 014-785-327-616-634; 016-380-434-727-636; 018-905-925-508-413; 021-098-866-846-50X; 021-877-058-238-242; 022-337-712-963-326; 024-310-161-738-837; 026-836-419-309-853; 044-574-489-310-046; 048-302-658-009-198; 050-502-123-336-086; 058-041-770-342-361; 058-969-903-186-090; 060-936-186-378-575; 061-539-802-228-296; 062-677-189-626-123; 064-729-913-564-934; 067-592-362-695-077; 067-837-080-233-176; 068-247-782-620-732; 071-620-061-891-103; 071-689-186-058-217; 077-877-914-553-248; 084-014-542-140-345; 085-451-964-146-968; 088-361-366-194-919; 096-594-859-020-279; 104-225-458-936-387; 124-525-773-526-468; 153-017-292-332-356; 160-962-278-422-144,21,false,,

However, there is ongoing debate about the acceptance of the HPV vaccine as a part of routine vaccine scheme. The aim of this study is to determine the baseline knowledge Turkish women have about HPV and prophylactic HPV vaccines.; ; Method:  The study included 1434 women from four different cities of Turkey who completed a 22-item questionnaire that assessed their knowledge of HPV and cervical cancer, and their acceptance of HPV vaccine for themselves and their children.; ; Results:  The median age was 35.8 ± 10.8 years (range: 17–80 years). In all, 12% of the participants had a past history of an abnormal Pap test. Among the participants, 77% believed that sex education should be provided at school, 45% had heard of HPV and 55% had no knowledge about HPV. It was known by 43% of the women that HPV might cause genital lesions. Of the parents, 40% knew HPV is related to cervical cancer, while 34% had no opinion about the subject. Of the parents interviewed, 70% reported they would accept HPV vaccination for themselves, 64% for their daughters and 59% for their sons.; ; Conclusion:  Although less than half of the women had knowledge about HPV, the majority of the women sampled reported that they would accept vaccination for themselves and their children.

The indication for vaginoplasty was Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome in 94 (87.0%), testicular feminization in 12 (11.1%), and hermaphroditism in 2 (1.9%) patients. The surgical procedures employed were Wharton in 53 patients (49.0%), Mclndoe in 47 (43.5%), gracilis myocutaneous flap in 3 (2.8%), sigmoid loop vaginoplasty in 2 (1.9%), and vaginoplasty using amnion in 3 (2.8%) patients. The overall anatomic success rate after vaginoplasty was 75.0% (81/108). This figure varies from 78.7% for patients subjected to the Mclndoe procedure to 71.6% for patients having Wharton vaginoplasty. Rectovaginal fistula was observed in only 3 patients (2.7%). The other leading complications were febrile morbidity in 13 (12.0%), infected hematoma in the neovagina in 2 (1.8%), and localized infection in 8 (7.4%) patients.

Boynukalin; Türkan Küçükali,"Objective; ; To evaluate our experience in patients with endometrial cancer found in simple hysterectomy.; ; ; ; Methods; ; Forty patients treated for endometrial cancer after simple hysterectomy were evaluated, retrospectively. Twenty-one patients (Group 1) underwent surgical staging procedure while 19 patients were not subjected to complementary surgical staging procedure (Group 2).; ; ; ; Results; ; The mean age was 53.80 years. Residual disease following reoperation was found in only four patients (19.0%). The three of them who were considered Stage IC (two Grade 1, one Grade 2) were found to be Stage IIIC and one patient who was considered Stage IB (Grade 2) was found to be Stage IIIC. The overall recurrence rates in Groups 1 and 2 were 4.8% versus 10.5% (P > 0.05). The overall disease-free survival rates were 95.24% in Group 1 and 87.50% in Group 2 (P > 0.05). Considering the patients who received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), the overall disease-free survival rates were 88.89% in Group 1 and 84.62% in Group 2 (P > 0.05).; ; ; ; Conclusion; ; We believe that complementary surgical staging may have benefit in patients with incompletely staged endometrial carcinoma excluding Stage IA G1 cases, since the recurrence rate has rising and disease-free survival estimate has decreasing tendencies in incompletely staged patients than that in complementary surgically staged ones.

Machine learning is a broad field that can produce results and estimations. In this study we constructed prediction models for EC patients using the Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm for LNI prediction. Methods The study assessed 762 patients with EC. Algorithm models were based on the following histopathological factors: V1: final histology; V2: presence of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI); V3: grade; V4: tumor diameter; V5: depth of myometrial invasion (MI); V6: cervical glandular stromal invasion (CGSI); V7: tubal or ovarian involvement; and V8: pelvic LNI. Logistic regression analysis was also used to evaluate the independent factors affecting LNI. Results The mean age of patients was 59.1 years. LNI was detected in 102 (13.4%) patients. Para-aortic LNI (PaLNI) was detected in 54 (7.1%) patients, of which four patients had isolated PaLNI. The accuracy rate of the algorithm models was found to be between 84.2% and 88.9% and 85.0% and 97.6% for LNI and PaLNI, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the histologic type, LVSI, depth of MI, and CGSI were independently and significantly associated with LNI (p Conclusions Machine learning may have a place in the decision tree for the management of EC. This is a preliminary report about the use of a new statistical technique. Larger studies with the addition of sentinel lymph node status, laboratory findings, or imaging results with machine learning algorithms may herald a new era in the management of EC.",29,2,320,324,Machine learning; Logistic regression; Artificial intelligence; Endometrial cancer; Sentinel lymph node; Lymphadenectomy; Lymph node; Stromal Invasion; Lymphovascular; Multivariate analysis; Medicine,endometrial cancer; lymph node involvement; lymph node status; machine learning,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Endometrial Neoplasms/pathology; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Machine Learning; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies",,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/29/2/320.full.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30718313 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30718313/ https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/29/2/320,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2018-000033,30718313,10.1136/ijgc-2018-000033,2910564476,,0,000-458-203-788-147; 001-194-784-399-923; 001-478-902-508-567; 005-443-583-705-496; 009-862-111-973-435; 017-466-815-809-671; 018-550-582-701-990; 021-018-188-200-52X; 024-859-053-598-046; 026-517-478-235-438; 028-116-346-880-975; 028-619-466-691-524; 030-379-795-258-774; 040-275-036-656-399; 044-553-238-011-76X; 045-149-789-046-709; 047-557-096-882-566; 051-770-132-620-289; 052-071-844-421-361; 052-790-885-508-632; 069-882-921-329-005; 076-270-908-239-976; 077-252-623-743-21X; 097-235-824-685-774; 105-848-805-818-180; 106-230-698-434-000; 108-551-072-351-06X; 109-176-440-253-223; 124-678-289-264-889; 148-166-599-858-115; 151-804-066-523-082,31,false,,

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with vaginal vault prolapse and underwent SSLF between January 2014 and May 2017. The subjective evaluation was performed according to the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I). The objective success rate at the end of 12 months was evaluated, and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification System (POP-Q) Stage 0 or 1 was considered as a successful outcome. The effectiveness of the operation and the complication rates were evaluated during one-year follow-up. Results: A total of 26 patients were included in the study. Twelve patients (46.2%) underwent unilateral SSLF and 14 patients (53.8%) bilateral SSLF operation. At 12 months, the objective and subjective success rates were 100% and 100%, respectively. There was a significant difference between the unilateral and bilateral SSLF groups in terms of the operation time and intraoperative bleeding. After one-year follow-up, only three patients (11.3%) complained about mild gluteal pain.  Conclusion: The suspension of the vagina to the unilateral or bilateral sacrospinous ligament was an effective and safe surgical method in patients with post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse.",44,2,549,555,Surgery; Retrospective cohort study; Fixation (surgical); Vagina; Hysterectomy; Vaginal Vault Prolapse; Sacrospinous ligament; Significant difference; Medicine; Complication,,,,,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/667822 https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/pub/cumj/issue/42404/457925,http://dx.doi.org/10.17826/cumj.457925,,10.17826/cumj.457925,2954689324,,0,000-575-670-851-419; 000-609-012-932-48X; 006-568-000-141-779; 007-252-352-861-644; 017-202-927-542-394; 024-004-125-180-316; 024-134-894-743-078; 025-952-575-929-941; 027-092-647-898-634; 027-880-205-351-858; 028-304-952-452-928; 029-089-590-237-426; 029-410-076-856-011; 030-592-827-723-531; 035-744-453-198-593; 036-474-431-158-776; 039-838-720-388-993; 043-241-561-670-969; 052-622-173-848-476; 059-740-912-342-703; 063-332-994-678-797; 066-998-178-286-795; 075-359-730-821-970; 079-032-819-617-475; 088-121-266-313-762; 118-121-905-806-114; 125-847-956-641-862; 131-524-470-278-531,0,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

We sought to capture the patient perceptions of the COVID-19 implications and the worldwide imposed treatment modifications. Methods A patient survey was conducted in 16 European countries, using a new COVID-19-related questionnaire, developed by ENGAGe and the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale questionnaire (HADS). The survey was promoted by national patient advocacy groups and charitable organisations. Findings We collected 1388 forms; 592 online and 796 hard-copy (May, 2020). We excluded 137 due to missing data. Median patients' age was 55 years (range: 18-89), 54.7% had ovarian cancer and 15.5% were preoperative. Even though 73.2% of patients named cancer as a risk factor for COVID-19, only 17.5% were more afraid of COVID-19 than their cancer condition, with advanced age (>70 years) as the only significant risk factor for that. Overall, 71% were concerned about cancer progression if their treatment/follow-up was cancelled/postponed. Most patients (64%) had their care continued as planned, but 72.3% (n = 892) said that they received no information around overall COVID-19 infection rates of patients and staff, testing or measures taken in their treating hospital. Mean HADS Anxiety and Depression Scores were 8.8 (range: 5.3-12) and 8.1 (range: 3.8-13.4), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified high HADS-depression scores, having experienced modifications of care due to the pandemic and concern about not being able to visit their doctor as independent predictors of patients' anxiety. Interpretation Gynaecological cancer patients expressed significant anxiety about progression of their disease due to modifications of care related to the COVID-19 pandemic and wished to pursue their treatment as planned despite the associated risks. Healthcare professionals should take this into consideration when making decisions that impact patients care in times of crisis and to develop initiatives to improve patients' communication and education.",10,1,208,219,Cancer; Young adult; Patient advocacy; Depression (differential diagnoses); Disease; Risk factor; Family medicine; Anxiety; Medicine; Pandemic,COVID-19; EU; anxiety; cancer; depression; expectation; gynaecologic oncology; patients; perspectives,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety/psychology; COVID-19/epidemiology; Depression/psychology; Europe; Fear/psychology; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female/psychology; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2/isolation & purification; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753798/ http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3605 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33205595 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cam4.3605 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cam4.3605 https://findresearcher.sdu.dk:8443/ws/files/175869583/cam4.3605.pdf https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/publications/perspectives-fears-and-expectations-of-patients-with-gynaecologic https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/covidwho-932418 https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3605 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33205595/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cam4.3605,33205595,10.1002/cam4.3605,3100446156,PMC7753798,0,005-030-309-685-087; 005-986-037-110-066; 009-724-901-021-505; 010-367-729-210-840; 019-168-055-398-271; 022-135-067-107-846; 036-135-447-099-831; 038-520-945-026-823; 039-006-044-092-49X; 047-165-267-080-582; 055-239-372-335-726; 070-107-354-861-043; 074-722-687-014-520; 074-950-237-624-609; 080-725-462-081-272; 082-625-658-647-797; 085-997-007-362-903,72,true,cc-by,gold

Material and methods The study was performed in the gynaecologic oncology department of Baskent School of Medicine Hospital, Ankara, Turkey between January 1(st) 2008 and January 1(st) 2009. Cardinal and uterosacral ligaments were serially sectioned in an alternative approach, and were examined by a senior gynaecologic pathologist. Clinical and pathological features and findings in sections of uterine ligaments were recorded. Study data were analysed using the SPSS 17.0 program. Results Thirty-two out of 38 cases had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (84.2 %), and six had non-squamous cell tumours (15.8%). Four cases had microscopic (10.5 %) and one case had macroscopic (2.6 %) tumour extension in cardinal ligaments. Mean tumour-free cardinal ligament length was 16.8±7.39 mm. Presence of tumour invasion in cardinal ligaments correlated significantly with pelvic lymph node metastasis (p=0.02). No isolated tumour deposits were found in any of the cases in serial sections of the cardinal or uterosacral ligaments. Conclusion This research was designed as a preliminary study. Future studies are needed to determine the optimal resection margins of the uterine ligaments in surgically treated stage IB cervical cancer. With continuing research and the development of newer surgical techniques, patients' quality of life will be optimised accordingly.",14,2,63,67,Radiology; Pathological; Radical surgery; Cervical cancer; Cardinal ligament; Stage IB cervical cancer; Radical Hysterectomy; Uterine Ligament; Histopathology; Medicine,Cervical cancer; histopathology; parametrectomy; radical hysterectomy,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24592076/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3881739 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592076,http://dx.doi.org/10.5152/jtgga.2013.05925,24592076,10.5152/jtgga.2013.05925,2062884867,PMC3881739,0,001-811-244-640-131; 015-703-848-613-177; 020-481-915-061-561; 021-333-063-322-283; 021-682-399-020-938; 027-845-655-514-745; 027-948-349-685-492; 028-452-300-729-21X; 030-804-671-576-070; 032-416-715-401-60X; 032-566-302-775-105; 036-124-209-751-755; 039-529-071-120-030; 048-765-392-879-532; 065-218-303-148-556; 074-277-143-972-322; 074-756-386-021-028; 103-565-680-306-719; 106-610-623-158-595; 144-231-473-825-687,0,true,,gold

There is little information on the occurrence of AKI after operations for gynecologic malignancies. This study aimed to determine the incidence of AKI in patients who underwent surgery for gynecological malignancies and determine the risk factors in those who developed postoperative AKI. Methodology A total of 1,000 patients were enrolled retrospectively from January 2007 to March 2013. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury. Perioperative variables of patients were collected from medical charts. Results The incidence of postoperative AKI was 8.8%, with stage 1 occurring in 5.9%, stage 2 in 2.4%, and stage 3 in 0.5% of the patients. Patients who had AKI were significantly older, had higher body mass index (BMI) higher preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and more frequently had a history of distant organ metastasis when compared with those who did not have AKI. When compared with patients who did not develop AKI postoperatively, longer operation times and intraoperative usage of higher amounts of erythrocyte suspension and fresh frozen plasma were seen in those who developed AKI. Conclusions Patients who had AKI were older, had higher BMI with higher preoperative CRP levels, more frequent distant organ metastasis, longer operation times, and higher amounts of blood transfused intraoperatively. Defining preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors for postoperative AKI and taking necessary precautions are important for the early detection and intervention of AKI.",15,7,e41836,,Medicine; Acute kidney injury; Perioperative; Incidence (geometry); Body mass index; Stage (stratigraphy); Guideline; Kidney disease; Surgery; Retrospective cohort study; Internal medicine; Pathology; Paleontology; Physics; Optics; Biology,acute kidney injury; gynecologic oncology surgery; gynecological cancer; gynecological malignancy; prolonged operation times,,,,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/original_article/pdf/160183/20230713-21267-i671w1.pdf https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.41836,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.41836,37575800,10.7759/cureus.41836,,PMC10423056,0,003-738-441-417-558; 005-223-378-065-843; 007-605-781-001-053; 007-659-759-105-845; 007-746-739-915-539; 009-140-691-404-671; 010-049-260-226-357; 011-583-230-626-241; 012-386-063-509-091; 013-382-312-337-648; 015-933-036-617-969; 016-328-415-274-821; 024-709-726-257-34X; 025-528-370-302-552; 038-136-576-343-228; 041-977-285-877-531; 046-286-671-939-429; 046-567-363-339-502; 054-601-605-539-184; 056-336-764-547-040; 064-449-675-430-431; 066-137-384-587-332; 066-747-533-491-632; 074-093-631-621-832; 078-912-704-482-442; 097-222-544-302-086; 097-685-813-133-77X; 104-327-016-048-806; 135-737-771-607-92X; 156-179-281-832-807,0,true,,gold

METHODS A multicenter, retrospective department database review was performed to identify patients with ovarian HGSC at 6 gynecologic oncology centers in Turkey. A total of 229 node-positive women with stage III ovarian HGSC who had undergone maximal or optimal cytoreductive surgery plus systematic lymphadenectomy followed by paclitaxel plus carboplatin combination chemotherapy were included. LNR, defined as the percentage of positive lymph nodes (LNs) to total nodes recovered, was stratified into 3 groups: LNR1 (<10%), LNR2 (10%≤LNR<50%), and LNR3 (≥50%). Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival data. Factors predictive of outcome were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS Thirty-one women (13.6%) were classified as stage IIIA1, 15 (6.6%) as stage IIIB, and 183 (79.9%) as stage IIIC. The median age at diagnosis was 56 (range, 18-87), and the median duration of follow-up was 36 months (range, 1-120 months). For the entire cohort, the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 52.8%. An increased LNR was associated with a decrease in 5-year OS from 65.1% for LNR1, 42.5% for LNR2, and 25.6% for LNR3, respectively (p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, women with LNR≥0.50 were 2.7 times more likely to die of their tumors (hazard ratio [HR]=2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.42-5.18; p<0.001). CONCLUSION LNR seems to be an independent prognostic factor for decreased OS in stage III ovarian HGSC patients.",29,1,e12,,Internal medicine; Oncology; Serous fluid; Stage (cooking); Hazard ratio; Gynecologic oncology; Lymph node; Stage IIIC; Combination chemotherapy; Proportional hazards model; Medicine,Analysis  Survival; Epithelial Ovarian Cancer; Lymph Node; Serous Cystadenecarcinom,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/diagnosis; Female; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Staging; Ovarian Neoplasms/diagnosis; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Turkey/epidemiology; Young Adult",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29185270/ https://www.ejgo.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2018.29.e12 https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2018.29.e12 http://acikerisim.baskent.edu.tr/handle/11727/3125 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29185270 https://www.ejgo.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/1114JGO/jgo-29-e12.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5709522 http://dspace.baskent.edu.tr:8080/xmlui/handle/11727/3125,http://dx.doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2018.29.e12,29185270,10.3802/jgo.2018.29.e12,2769810425,PMC5709522,0,003-420-184-311-09X; 009-039-131-426-956; 013-975-919-239-191; 014-147-524-679-910; 015-826-651-480-956; 025-395-997-469-368; 032-854-871-734-879; 034-875-996-391-502; 035-735-883-554-688; 037-470-411-045-561; 040-996-625-227-314; 042-388-703-432-14X; 046-858-391-702-049; 047-230-111-229-967; 050-711-019-154-611; 050-802-064-002-223; 059-180-770-579-752; 067-174-246-255-187; 102-915-439-387-20X; 160-066-724-640-243,10,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Although radical vaginal trachelectomy (RVT) is suggested as a fertility preserving approach, there are some serious concerns like cervical stenosis, second trimester loss, preterm delivery in survivors, and lack of residual tumor in the majority of the surgical specimens. Therefore, less radical surgical operations have been proposed in early-stage cervical carcinomas. On the other hand, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is an evolving endoscopic approach for minimal access surgery. In this report, we present a case with early-stage cervical cancer who wishes to preserve fertility. We successfully performed single-port pelvic lymphadenectomy and large conization to preserve fertility potential of the patient. We think that combination of less radical approach like conization and single-port pelvic lymphadenectomy might be less minimally invasive and is still an effective surgical approach in well-selected cases with cervical carcinomas. Incorporation of single-port laparoscopy into the minimally invasive fertility sparing management of the cervical cancer will improve patients outcome with less complications and better cosmesis. Further studies are needed to reach a clear conclusion.",2013,,207191,207191,Surgery; Stage (cooking); Laparoscopic surgery; Fertility preservation; Cervical cancer; Laparoscopy; Gynecologic oncology; Cosmesis; Fertility; Medicine,,,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cris/2013/207191.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816043 https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cris/2013/207191/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24223319/ https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=84ea90fe-2379-4f86-8d23-0113231a7c12 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3816043 http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cris/2013/207191.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/207191,24223319,10.1155/2013/207191,2030407585,PMC3816043,0,011-156-745-823-344; 017-665-621-954-653; 023-725-732-906-522; 024-329-634-446-309; 031-985-278-147-95X; 033-877-197-487-703; 037-830-064-570-594; 045-512-697-985-729; 047-881-073-598-188; 053-253-611-828-877; 055-138-366-689-680; 058-137-849-682-605; 066-258-143-819-236; 071-826-095-321-823; 072-673-053-804-52X; 079-189-232-470-457; 083-614-798-905-252; 114-479-466-219-903; 128-510-335-412-405; 133-164-360-416-442; 134-686-746-638-608,4,true,cc-by,gold

The databases of seven gynaecologic cancer centres were searched in order to identify all consecutive gynaecologic cancer patients undergoing major surgery between March 11, 2020 and May 15, 2020 for this retrospective, case-control study. The case group consisted of patients with histopathologically confirmed gynaecologic cancers, and each case was matched with two counterparts who had undergone primary surgery before the COVID-19 pandemic. The case and the control groups were compared in terms of length of hospital stay, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), intraoperative and postoperative complications.During the study period, 154 women with gynaecologic cancer undergoing major surgery were identified. Although the case group had more co-morbidities compared to the control group (103/154 vs. 178/308, respectively; p = .04), the median length of hospital stays, the rate of ICU admission, intraoperative complication rates and postoperative complication rates were similar in the two groups. Gynaecologic cancer surgery may be performed safely in the COVID-19 era with similar rates of ICU admission, intraoperative and postoperative complications compared to the patients operated before the COVID-19 pandemic.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Many societies have announced their guidelines about the surgical management of gynaecologic cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of them are not evidence-based and mostly on expert opinions.What do the results of this study add? The main findings of this retrospective, case-control study indicate that the short-term (30 day) outcomes of gynaecologic cancer patients undergoing major surgery in the COVID-19 era are similar to those who had been operated before the COVID-19 pandemic. The length of hospital stays, the rates of admission to the ICU, intraoperative and postoperative complications were comparable between women undergoing major gynaecologic cancer surgery in the COVID-19 era and the women who had been operated before the pandemic.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? We can suggest that definitive surgery may be performed for gynaecologic cancer patients in the COVID-19 era if the resources permit and appropriate precautions such as social distancing, isolation and the use of personal protective equipment are taken.",42,5,1,7,Surgery; Case-control study; Intensive care unit; Isolation (health care); Intraoperative Complication; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Gynaecologic cancer; Postoperative complication; Perioperative; Medicine,Coronavirus infection; gynaecologic neoplasms; period; perioperative; severe acute respiratory syndrome; surgery,"COVID-19/epidemiology; COVID-19 Testing; Case-Control Studies; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female/diagnosis; Humans; Pandemics/prevention & control; Postoperative Complications/epidemiology; Retrospective Studies",,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443615.2021.1959535 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34704523/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2021.1959535,34704523,10.1080/01443615.2021.1959535,3211131831,,0,000-504-141-619-560; 001-682-347-463-416; 004-766-459-567-110; 013-767-109-587-462; 019-168-055-398-271; 021-476-974-960-137; 028-405-754-897-785; 028-787-234-320-372; 035-027-236-512-863; 036-135-447-099-831; 037-669-338-171-323; 044-277-668-258-449; 045-179-890-315-237; 045-963-288-601-491; 047-094-185-103-44X; 049-927-927-827-137; 063-192-497-873-370; 065-607-147-626-008; 081-965-954-649-548; 083-428-022-472-470; 128-833-149-756-569; 171-288-147-881-196,0,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC",gold

METHODS A multicenter, retrospective, department database review was performed to identify LVSI-positive patients with stage IIIC endometrioid EC at five gynecological oncology centers in Turkey. Demographic, clinicopathological and survival data were collected. RESULTS We identified 172 LVSI-positive women with stage IIIC endometrioid EC during the study period; 75 (43.6%) were classified as Stage IIIC1 and 97 (56.4%) as Stage IIIC2 . The median age at diagnosis was 59 years, and the median duration of follow up was 34.5 months. The total number of recurrences was 46 (26.7%). We observed 14 (8.1%) locoregional recurrences, 12 (7.0%) retroperitoneal failures and 20 (11.6%) distant relapses. For the entire study cohort, 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 67.4%, while the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 75.1%. Grade 3 histology (hazard ratio [HR] 2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-5.12; P = 0.005), cervical stromal invasion (HR 2.33, 95% CI 1.09-4.99; P = 0.028) and myometrial invasion (MMI) ≥50% (HR 4.0, 95% CI 1.16-13.69; P = 0.028) were found to be independent prognostic factors for decreased OS. CONCLUSION Uterine factors such as grade 3 disease, cervical stromal invasion and deep MMI seem to be independently associated with decreased OS in LVSI-positive women with stage IIIC endometrioid EC. The high distant recurrence rate in this subgroup of patients warrants further studies in order to identify the most effective treatment strategy for those patients.",44,6,1140,1149,Internal medicine; Stage (cooking); Hazard ratio; Endometrial cancer; Stromal Invasion; Lymphovascular; Stage IIIC; Confidence interval; Medicine; Cohort; Gastroenterology,endometrioid-type endometrial cancer; lymphovascular space invasion; recurrence; stage IIIC disease,"Carcinoma, Endometrioid/diagnosis; Disease-Free Survival; Endometrial Neoplasms/chemically induced; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lymphatic Vessels/pathology; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Turkey/epidemiology",,,https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jog.13615 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29516573 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29516573,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jog.13615,29516573,10.1111/jog.13615,2791430453,,0,000-876-938-761-270; 003-580-647-011-126; 003-996-512-539-483; 005-680-271-301-90X; 008-388-167-580-153; 008-462-397-826-377; 009-243-672-803-29X; 011-024-502-430-699; 012-106-258-640-373; 024-866-712-451-706; 027-744-709-016-897; 028-715-358-210-99X; 029-265-402-255-003; 031-294-556-129-565; 033-734-224-976-468; 035-223-072-394-52X; 054-255-535-059-396; 056-730-286-373-845; 058-606-587-817-555; 059-547-966-457-309; 059-766-886-794-09X; 068-895-426-079-754; 076-672-587-045-792; 088-019-192-264-29X; 100-714-660-814-609; 124-678-289-264-889; 130-945-879-284-952; 141-841-757-227-215; 145-652-290-462-432; 159-728-012-041-036,6,false,,

Recently, assisted reproductive treatments have been performed to achieve a rapid pregnancy in such cases. This report evaluates a 39-year-old woman who admitted with menorrhagia and primary infertility. Owing to persistent menstrual irregularity and thick endometrium, a diagnostic office hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy was performed and revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Although the woman wished to retain her childbearing potential with conservative management followed by an assisted reproduction cycle, the repeated endometrial biopsies during progestin treatment revealed persistent adenocarcinoma. Complementary surgery was performed due to persistent endometrial malignancy, which noted well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma without myometrial invasion or extrauterine disease. A review of cases with endometrial carcinoma that have been treated with conservative management and a subsequent assisted cycle is also presented here. To date, there are 14 such reports, including 15 women and 21 healthy infants. However, obtaining remission and maintaining the reproductive capability may not always be possible, even in early-stage cases.

Materials and Methods: The medical records of patients treated for G3-EAC and UCS between January 1996 and December 2016 at 11 gynecologic oncology centers in Turkey and Germany were analyzed. Results: Of all patients included in the study, 161 (45.1%) were diagnosed with UCS and 196 (54.9%) with G3-EAC at FIGO stage I–II (early stage) disease. The recurrence rate was higher in patients with UCS than in those with G3-EAC (17.4 vs. 9.2%, p = 0.02).

MATERIALS AND METHOD 12 patients treated for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma from January 2007 to June 2009 in Baskent University Ankara Hospital, Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics were evaluated. In a retrospective observational study design tumour stage, grade, differentiation, time from first symptoms, pleural involvement, peritoneal cancer index, surgical cytoreduction, chemotherapeutic regimen, number of cycles, disease free survival and overall survival were evaluated. Disease free survival, overall survival, time until first symptoms were researched. RESULTS The main presenting symptom was abdominal distension. Primary cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy was performed in 9 patients. In 6 patients completeness of cytoreductive score below 2 was achieved. As a first line chemotherapy the most often used was cisplatin in combination with pemetrexed. Themean time from first symptoms until the diagnosis was 1.9 months. Disease free survival of 4.4±1.0 months after completing particular treatment and overall 1-year survival of 85.7 % was observed. No correlations between first symptoms (0.27, p=0.52), time until the diagnosis (-0.29, p=0.44) and overall survival were observed. Similarly, correlations between peritoneal cancer index (0.25, p=0.67), prior surgical score (-.45, p=0.37), completeness of cytoreduction score (0.61, p=0.27) and overall survival were not observed. CONCLUSIONS Because of the low number of patients and different treatment approaches data from a particular patient setting are inconclusive, but from the literature there is evidence that patients with malignant intraperitoneal mesothelioma should undergo optimal cytoreduction and receive a combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed as a first line chemotherapy for intravenous or cisplatin in different chemotherapy regimens using the intraperitoneal administration route, if accessible, with even higher overall survival rates.",12,2,104,109,Internal medicine; Oncology; Retrospective cohort study; Chemotherapy; Pemetrexed; Mesothelioma; Cisplatin; Abdominal distension; Regimen; Peritoneal Cancer Index; Bioinformatics; Medicine,Mesothelioma; intraperitoneal,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3939100 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24591971,http://dx.doi.org/10.5152/jtgga.2011.24,24591971,10.5152/jtgga.2011.24,2010793340,PMC3939100,0,000-608-346-378-656; 001-260-818-419-148; 006-228-467-826-13X; 009-509-979-091-894; 009-518-972-136-337; 011-508-211-779-787; 016-799-504-056-501; 017-629-442-229-917; 017-788-403-838-910; 020-225-749-305-432; 027-041-127-156-071; 031-937-512-210-747; 036-399-440-662-985; 036-557-829-069-670; 038-417-616-008-848; 038-607-955-237-175; 041-655-183-940-657; 051-645-477-013-561; 055-597-054-689-377; 057-755-080-481-581; 060-208-025-194-964; 065-443-736-179-746; 065-852-107-027-990; 067-966-034-838-896; 071-972-512-436-150; 086-203-110-034-106; 086-459-071-091-528; 100-035-548-649-901; 102-269-367-794-557; 115-670-904-140-640; 134-996-477-460-058; 135-888-781-450-231; 136-260-948-818-417; 171-777-047-533-853,1,true,,gold

PD-L1 and PD-L2, and tumor protein p53 (p53) were examined in 20 uterine adenosarcoma cases, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-associated macrophages were counted in tumor tissue using immunohistochemistry. While CPS PD-L1 positivity with 1% and 10% cut-off values was observed in 40% and 10% of tumors, respectively, CPS PD-L2 positivity with 1%, 10% and 50% cut-off values was observed in 100%, 85% and 50% of the tumors, respectively. The CPS PD-L2 positivity with a 50% cut-off value was positively correlated with tumor grade and the presence of sarcomatous overgrowth and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (p = 0.025, p = 0.025, and p = 0.025, respectively). Nine of 11 high-grade adenosarcomas and none of the low-grade adenosarcomas showed mutant type p53 expression (p = 0.000). However, PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells did not correlate with clinicopathological parameters. The CPS PD-L2 positivity with a 50% cut-off value was also positively correlated with mutant type p53 expression (p = 0.024) and tumor-associated macrophages density (p = 0.024). The CPS PD-L2 positivity with a 50% cut-off value and mutant type p53 expression were associated with shorter disease-free survival and shorter overall survival. The high density of tumor-associated macrophages and low density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were also associated with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival (p < 0.05).These results suggested that the CPS PD-L2 positivity with a 50% cut-off value, p53 mutation and tumor microenvironment played an essential role in the progression of uterine adenosarcomas.",31,4,352,364,Mutant; Correlation; Morphology (biology); Immunohistochemistry; Biology; Pathology; Medicine; Genetics; Gene; Geometry; Mathematics,PD-L1; PD-L2; adenosarcoma; p53; tumor microenvironment,"Female; Humans; Adenosarcoma; B7-H1 Antigen/genetics; Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics; Ligands; Prognosis; Tumor Microenvironment; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics","B7-H1 Antigen; Biomarkers, Tumor; Ligands; TP53 protein, human; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53; PDCD1LG2 protein, human",Funding: This study is supported by Baskent University Scientific Research Committee (KA21/418).,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10668969221095189,35466759,10.1177/10668969221095189,,,0,000-751-121-720-90X; 004-120-743-169-088; 004-216-046-585-699; 005-841-643-012-362; 006-973-921-173-387; 008-596-041-117-610; 010-246-142-071-078; 012-131-802-755-006; 013-242-316-483-031; 015-624-159-566-947; 015-888-543-120-703; 016-493-594-625-269; 016-934-996-080-872; 021-454-074-055-628; 021-815-730-729-08X; 022-557-010-225-112; 023-015-427-030-484; 023-954-651-013-465; 025-981-977-177-642; 026-271-710-756-40X; 028-675-197-195-819; 029-892-987-319-123; 035-217-050-269-970; 036-830-171-334-646; 038-734-399-013-059; 040-768-970-770-807; 044-938-232-147-129; 045-995-299-664-320; 051-110-602-468-258; 057-170-648-199-869; 064-825-009-403-817; 076-573-116-791-373; 082-163-848-711-506; 083-364-562-467-285; 107-443-535-124-150; 115-526-703-418-769; 120-067-412-950-019; 131-566-973-960-642; 171-145-029-560-22X,2,false,,

Methods SATEN III was a retrospective study involving 13 centers from 10 countries. Patients who had been operated on between 1998 and 2018 and diagnosed with stage III endometrioid EC were analyzed. Results A total of 990 women were identified; 317 with stage IIIA, 18 with stage IIIB, and 655 with stage IIIC diseases. The median follow-up was 42 months. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with stage III EC by adjuvant treatment modality was 68.5% for radiotherapy (RT), 54.6% for chemotherapy (CT), and 69.4% for chemoradiation (CRT) (p=0.11). The 5-year overall survival (OS) for those patients was 75.6% for RT, 75% for CT, and 80.7% for CRT (p=0.48). For patients with stage IIIA disease treated by RT versus CT versus CRT, the 5-year OS rates were 75.6%, 75.0%, and 80.7%, respectively (p=0.48). Negative peritoneal cytology (HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.86; p=0.02) and performance of lymphadenectomy (HR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.77, p=0.001) were independent predictors for improved OS for stage IIIA EC. For women with stage IIIC EC treated by RT, CT, and CRT, the 5-year OS rates were 78.9%, 67.0%, and 69.8%, respectively (p=0.08). Independent prognostic factors for better OS for stage IIIC disease were age Discussion Although not statistically significant, CRT seemed to be a better adjuvant treatment option for stage IIIA endometrioid EC.

Nied,"In this study, three-dimensional enriched crack tip elements were employed to analyze interracial cracking problems encountered in electronic packaging. These elements are located at the crack tip region and contain the correct 3-D crack tip displacement and singular strain fields with unknown stress intensity factors, Using enriched elements, the elastic-plastic behavior of solder balls and interaction effects with nearby cracks in a flip-chip semiconductor package were investigated. Applying periodicity bounda~ conditions, a slice near the central region of the device was considered, Results from two differently shaped interracial cracks near the fillet region are presented, Including plasticity effects on the solder balls, the interaction between plastic deformation and fracture parameters was investigated (elastic crack tip behavior). The two interracial crack configurations are; a vertical crack between the fillet and the Si-chip, and an “L” shaped crack between the undertlll material and the chip, The results from these calculations showed that plastic deformation, especially on the outermost solder ball, is affected by the presence of a crack in its vicinity and vice versa. It was observed that the plastic strains increase as the crack tip approaches the outermost solder ball. Depending on the type of crack under consideration, the fracture parameters can also vary significantly along the crack front even for the straight through cracks presented in this paper. In studying the “L” shaped crack, it was concluded that inclusion of crack surface contact is critical for accurate determination of plastic strains and fracture parameters.",37,,,,Crack growth resistance curve; Fillet (mechanics); Composite material; Materials science; Fracture (geology); Crack tip opening displacement; Stress intensity factor; Fracture mechanics; Structural engineering; Crack closure; Plasticity,,,,,https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/DM02/DM02011FU.pdf https://www.witpress.com/elibrary/wit-transactions-on-engineering-sciences/37/1314,https://www.witpress.com/elibrary/wit-transactions-on-engineering-sciences/37/1314,,,2290658287,,0,036-021-809-386-550; 046-256-549-718-588; 063-475-659-067-292; 099-507-346-713-070; 140-499-144-907-253,0,false,,

METHODS A multicenter, retrospective department database review was performed to identify patients with stage IIIC pure endometrioid EC at 6 gynecologic oncology centers in Turkey. A total of 207 women were included. LNR, defined as the percentage of positive lymph nodes (LNs) to total nodes recovered, was stratified into 2 groups: LNR1 (≤0.15), and LNR2 (>0.15). Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival data. Factors predictive of outcome were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS One hundred and one (48.8%) were classified as stage IIIC1 and 106 (51.2%) as stage IIIC2. The median age at diagnosis was 58 (range, 30-82) and the median duration of follow-up was 40 months (range, 1-228 months). There were 167 (80.7%) women with LNR ≤0.15, and 40 (19.3%) women with LNR >0.15. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates for LNR ≤0.15 and LNR >0.15 were 76.1%, and 58.5%, respectively (p=0.045). An increased LNR was associated with a decrease in 5-year overall survival (OS) from 87.0% for LNR ≤0.15 to 62.3% for LNR >0.15 (p=0.005). LNR >0.15 was found to be an independent prognostic factor for both PFS (hazard ratio [HR]=2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07-3.93; p=0.03) and OS (HR=3.35; 95% CI=1.57-7.19; p=0.002). CONCLUSION LNR seems to be an independent prognostic factor for decreased PFS and OS in stage IIIC pure endometrioid EC.",29,4,e48,,Internal medicine; Stage (cooking); Hazard ratio; Survival rate; Endometrial cancer; Gynecologic oncology; Lymph node; Stage IIIC; Proportional hazards model; Medicine; Gastroenterology,Disease-Free Survival; Endometrial Neoplasms; Endometrioid Carcinoma; Lymph Node Excision; Survival Rate,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Endometrioid/mortality; Endometrial Neoplasms/mortality; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Turkey/epidemiology",,,https://ejgo.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2018.29.e48 https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2018.29.e48 http://acikerisim.baskent.edu.tr/handle/11727/3117 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29770619 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5981100 https://synapse.koreamed.org/upload/SynapseData/PDFData/1114jgo/jgo-29-e48.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29770619 https://ejgo.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/1114JGO/jgo-29-e48.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2018.29.e48,29770619,10.3802/jgo.2018.29.e48,2789934591,PMC5981100,0,000-876-938-761-270; 003-906-889-330-741; 003-996-512-539-483; 010-078-240-181-182; 010-620-464-544-322; 011-024-502-430-699; 011-301-725-121-941; 014-578-446-210-731; 014-596-519-950-642; 014-807-163-327-266; 025-967-408-148-461; 026-282-541-654-501; 031-294-556-129-565; 034-481-252-537-802; 035-223-072-394-52X; 046-858-391-702-049; 048-013-354-173-836; 054-911-225-712-655; 056-730-286-373-845; 063-099-759-058-768; 064-473-822-351-662; 066-263-601-041-174; 079-037-588-012-753; 087-303-150-183-477; 098-663-995-967-941; 120-738-288-740-114; 124-678-289-264-889; 127-900-884-012-380; 152-507-348-270-904,12,true,cc-by-nc,gold

C. Kaya; Adrian Loghin; J. H. Laflen; R. D. McClain; D. Slavik,"A methodology for performing two and three-dimensional fracture analyses in orthotropic materials using ANSYS software (“ANSYS”) is presented. The methodology makes use of analytically known crack tip fields in orthotropic materials and is implemented into a general purpose ANSYS macro. The ANSYS analysis, which takes into account the material orthotropy is performed in a regular manner by including the quarter point elements near the crack front. Then, in the post-processing module, the developed macro is run to associate the crack tip displacements with the orthotropic crack tip displacement fields to compute the mixed-mode stress intensity factors. Numerical examples are also presented that demonstrate application and validation of the procedure. These examples include an edge crack in an orthotropic strip and a surface crack in a transversely isotropic plate. The results show how the orthotropic fracture results may differ from those of isotropic fracture analysis. It is also shown that this difference can be dramatically big when the stress analysis is done using the orthotropic properties, whereas the fracture calculations are performed considering the crack tip fields for a crack in an isotropic material.Copyright © 2006 by ASME",,,873,881,Transverse isotropy; Orthotropic material; Isotropy; Materials science; Fracture (geology); Crack tip opening displacement; Stress intensity factor; Fracture mechanics; Structural engineering; Stress (mechanics),,,,,https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1590827 http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1590827 https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings/GT2006/42401/873/315546 https://verification.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings/GT2006/42401/873/315546,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/gt2006-90599,,10.1115/gt2006-90599,2333120676,,0,,12,false,,

Paraffin-embedded ICC specimens were identified from the histopathologic archives of the Hacettepe University Medical School in Turkey. HPV detection was carried out through amplification of HPV DNA by a SPF-10 broad-spectrum primer polymerase chain reaction and subsequently followed by DNA enzyme immunoassay and genotyping by LiPA25 (version 1). Two hundred seventy-seven ICC cases diagnosed between 1993 and 2004 were retrieved. After histologic evaluation and human beta-globin gene analysis for sample quality, 248 cases were considered suitable for HPV/DNA testing. HPV prevalence was 93.5% (232/248; 95% confidence interval: 90.5%-96.6%). The five most common HPV types identified as single types among HPV-positive cases were HPV16 (64.7%), HPV18 (9.9%), HPV45 (9.9%), HPV31 (3.0%), and HPV33 (2.2%). The study shows that in Turkey, HPV16/HPV18 accounted for 75.4% (95% confidence interval: 69.9%-81.0%) of HPV-positive ICC cases.

The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinicopathological characteristics of women with squamous and glandular cell carcinoma vulva who underwent primary surgical management. <h3>Methodology</h3> A retrospective analysis was conducted on 649 patients who were treated for squamous and glandular cell carcinoma of the vulva at a multicenter in Turkey. <h3>Results</h3> The mean age of patients was 63.2 ± 12.8 years. The most common location for the disease was lateral (55.5%) and then midline (39.6%) and bilateral (0.6%). The surgical treatments for the primary tumor region were radical vulvectomy (80.1%) and simple vulvectomy (19.9%). The surgical margin was negative in 469 (72.3%) patients. The procedure of unilateral or bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy underwent respectively 77 (11.9%) and 453 (69.8%) patients. The mean number of lymph nodes dissected was 12.8 ± 7.2. The number of patients with lymph node metastasis was 247 (44.5%). Three hundred and eighty-eight cases were in FIGO stage I-II and 234 cases were in stage III. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were required respectively for 165 (25.4%) and 141 (21.7%) patients. Recurrence developed in one hundred and seventy-three (26.7%) patients. Of these, 100 (15.4%) were local, 54 (8.3%) were inguinal lymph nodes, and 19 (2.9%) were multiple and/or distant. It was determined that the tumor size was larger (P= 0.017) and lymph node involvement was higher (P&lt; 0.001) in those who developed recurrence. Also, it was detected that surgical margin status and histological subtype was effect statistically significant the recurrence rate. <h3>Conclusion</h3> For patients with squamous and glandular cell carcinoma of the vulva, a surgical operation is the primary. Most important factors effecting recurrence are related to surgical quality. <h3>Disclosures</h3> There is no potential conflict of interest (e.g., grant support, consultancy, membership on advisory councils, speaker's bureau) and source of funding.",,,A390.1,A390,Medicine; Oncology; Dermatology,,,,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/33/Suppl_3/A390.1.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.828,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.828,,10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.828,,,0,,0,true,other-oa,hybrid

The important part of literature on ovarian cancer surgery emphasize residual tumor and survival analyses. Morbidity issue keeps in background. Therefore, we aimed to report on morbidity of cytoreductive surgery for EOC in this study.; Methods; EOC patients who underwent primary debulking were evaluated. Intraoperative and postoperative complications that occurred within 30 days after the surgery and factors that affect morbidity were considered.; Results; The study involved 359 patients. Forty-six intraoperative complications occurred in 42 (11.6%) patients. Advanced stage and cancer antigen level of 125 were independently and significantly associated with operative complications (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-2,73; P=0.044, and HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.05-2.06; P=0.025, respectively). The need for intensive care unit admission was significantly higher in patients with intraoperative complications (28.6% vs. 8.8%, P=0.001). Intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were significantly higher in extended surgery than in standard surgery (18.9%vs. 8.5%, P=0.005 and 38.7% vs. 10.9%, P<0.001, respectively). Intraoperative and postoperative transfusion need, hospital stay duration, and chemotherapy start day were also significantly higher in extended surgery than in standard surgery. Hundred postoperative complications occurred in 70 patients. Age, extended surgery, presence of ascites, and presence of operative complications were independently and significantly associated with postoperative complications.; Conclusion; Morbidity of extensive surgical approach should be kept in mind in ovarian cancer surgery aimed at leaving no residual tumor. Patient-based management with an appropriate preoperative evaluation may avoid morbidity of extended/extensive surgical approaches.",63,1,64,71,Surgery; Hazard ratio; Intensive care unit; Chemotherapy; Ovarian cancer; Ascites; Debulking; Postoperative complication; Pharmacotherapy; Medicine,Cytoreduction; Epithelial ovarian cancer; Morbidity; Ovarian cancer; Primary debulking,,,,http://www.ogscience.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.5468/ogs.2020.63.1.64 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31970129/ http://www.ogscience.org/upload/pdf/ogs-63-64.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6962589 http://dspace.kci.go.kr/handle/kci/1325458,http://dx.doi.org/10.5468/ogs.2020.63.1.64,31970129,10.5468/ogs.2020.63.1.64,2999103821,PMC6962589,0,001-924-514-779-397; 003-153-054-705-193; 004-264-307-821-458; 004-729-505-666-740; 005-750-998-537-148; 006-173-353-920-392; 007-566-777-754-117; 007-827-655-712-640; 014-023-714-538-057; 020-722-662-395-76X; 029-880-616-965-814; 036-408-201-281-933; 036-678-720-499-643; 038-917-761-305-081; 043-399-672-526-193; 080-113-826-553-406; 086-884-736-381-755; 133-461-297-338-285,20,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Spleen involvement regions were divided into four main groups, and the groups were classified as capsule, hilus, capsule + hilus, and other region involvement (paranchyma ± other(s) involvement site). The overall survivals of these four groups were compared.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The mean age of the study group was 57.9 years, and the mean follow-up period of the patients was 43.2 months. The splenic involvement site was most frequently observed as hilus + capsule (42.2% n:121). Splenic parenchymal involvement was present in 27.9% (n: 80) of the patients. The overall survival for patients was 42 months. In the subgroup analysis, the worst overall survival was found in the group with capsule involvement at 33 months<jats:bold>.</jats:bold><jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold>While parenchymal involvement of the spleen was considered to be stage IV according to FIGO staging, we could not detect low overall survival in patients with parenchymal involvement in our study. Our study, which has the largest number in the literature examining the relationship between splenic involvement and overall survival, can provide a remarkable perspective on the relationship between parenchymal involvement of the spleen and prognosis.</jats:p>",,,,,Epithelial cancer; Overall survival; Cancer research; Text mining; Medicine,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-338983/v1 https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-338983/v1.pdf?c=1631898668000 https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR350645,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-338983/v1,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-338983/v1,3167872274,,0,,1,true,cc-by,green

Individuals with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 stage IB1-IIA1 cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy and had negative lymph nodes at final histology were included. Patients were treated at referral centers for gynecologic oncology according to updated national and international guidelines. Optimal cutoffs for surgical volume were identified using an unadjusted Cox proportional hazard model, with disease-free survival as the outcome and defined as the value that minimizes the P-value of the split in groups in terms of disease-free survival. Propensity score matching was used to create statistically similar cohorts at baseline.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 2,157 patients were initially included. The two most significant cutoffs for surgical volume were identified at seven and 17 surgical procedures, dividing the entire cohort into low-volume, middle-volume, and high-volume centers. After propensity score matching, 1,238 patients were analyzed-619 (50.0%) in the high-volume group, 523 (42.2%) in the middle-volume group, and 96 (7.8%) in the low-volume group. Patients who underwent surgery in higher-volume institutions had progressively better 5-year disease-free survival than those who underwent surgery in lower-volume centers (92.3% vs 88.9% vs 83.8%, P=.029). No difference was noted in 5-year overall survival (95.9% vs 97.2% vs 95.2%, P=.70). Cox multivariable regression analysis showed that FIGO stage greater than IB1, presence of lymphovascular space invasion, grade greater than 1, tumor diameter greater than 20 mm, minimally invasive surgical approach, nonsquamous cell carcinoma histology, and lower-volume centers represented independent risk factors for recurrence.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Surgical volume of centers represented an independent prognostic factor affecting disease-free survival.

Sexual problems arising after chemotherapy are decreased interest and vaginal lubrication, lack of orgasm and dyspareunia and sense of reduction in sexual attractiveness in general. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes that patients who receive chemotherapy for a gynecologic oncology disorder experience in their sexual functions. Materials and Methods: A descriptive/cross-sectional and qualitative study was performed. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used in order to collect data on sexual capacity. The quantitative data obtained were evaluated with frequency and percentage calculations while content analysis was performed for the qualitative data. Results: All of the information related to sexuality was provided by the physician. Chemotherapy treatment affected sexuality negatively in 55.9%. Since receiving the diagnosis, 52.9% of women had experienced no sexual intercourse at all. Those who had an FSFI score of 30 and below made up 75% of the women. After the content analysis of data obtained during in in-depth interviewing, we focused on three main themes: desire for sexual intercourse, problems experienced during sexual intercourse, and coping with problems. Conclusions: An integrated system where sexual problems can be handled professionally should be present during gynecological cancer treatment.",14,6,3561,3564,Sexual function; Sexual dysfunction; Orgasm; Sexual intercourse; Gynecologic oncology; Vaginal lubrication; Gynecology; Human sexuality; Clinical psychology; Medicine; Sexual attraction,,"Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects; Carboplatin/administration & dosage; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genital Neoplasms, Female/complications; Humans; Middle Aged; Paclitaxel/administration & dosage; Prognosis; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/chemically induced; Sexual Dysfunctions, Psychological/chemically induced; Surveys and Questionnaires; Turkey; Women's Health",Carboplatin; Paclitaxel,,http://koreascience.or.kr:80/article/JAKO201332479511375.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23886145/ http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=POCPA9_2013_v14n6_3561 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886145,http://dx.doi.org/10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.6.3561,23886145,10.7314/apjcp.2013.14.6.3561,2167637705,,0,004-978-822-436-858; 006-532-191-269-948; 008-360-343-276-309; 008-441-322-340-230; 008-619-600-800-504; 011-135-310-082-820; 011-407-377-441-783; 022-447-145-374-134; 038-706-545-291-068; 039-239-321-911-703; 055-376-565-892-87X; 072-736-629-621-669; 076-054-375-869-10X; 076-477-200-061-39X; 079-322-029-679-159; 091-206-660-817-281; 101-493-966-730-061; 117-533-631-308-680,30,true,cc-by,gold

Methods Patients who underwent primary surgery for endometrial cancer with an SLN algorithm were reviewed. Indocyanine green or blue dye was used as a tracer. SLNs and/or suspicious lymph nodes were resected. Side specific lymphadenectomy was performed when mapping was unsuccessful. SLNs were ultrastaged on final pathology. Results 357 eligible patients were analyzed. Median age was 59 years. Median number of resected SLNs was 2 (range 1–12) per patient. Minimal invasive and open surgeries were performed in 264 (73.9%) and 93 (26.1%) patients, respectively. Indocyanine green was used in 231 (64.7%) and blue dye in 126 (35.3%) patients. The dyes were injected into the cervix in 355 (99.4%) patients. The overall and bilateral SLN detection rates were 91.9% and 71.4%, respectively. The mapping rates using indocyanine green or blue dye were comparable (P=0.526). There were 43 (12%) patients with lymphatic metastasis. The SLN algorithm was not able to detect 3 of 43 patients who had isolated paraaortic metastasis. After SLN biopsy, complete pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 286 (80.1%) patients. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were both 100% for the detection of pelvic lymph node metastases. In addition, 117 (32.8%) patients underwent completion paraaortic lymphadenectomy after SLN biopsy. In these patients, sensitivity for detecting metastases to pelvic and/or paraaortic lymph nodes was 90.3% with a negative predictive value of 96.6%. The risk of non-SLN involvement in patients with macrometastatic SLNs, micrometastatic SLNs, and isolated tumor cells in SLNs were 61.2%, 14.3% and 0%, respectively. Conclusions SLN biopsy had good accuracy in detecting lymphatic metastasis. However, one-third of cases with metastatic SLNs also had non-SLN involvement and this risk increased to two-thirds of cases with macrometastatic SLNs. The effect of leaving these nodes in situ on survival should be evaluated in further studies.",30,3,299,304,Radiology; Biopsy; Endometrial cancer; Metastasis; Sentinel lymph node; Lymphadenectomy; Lymph node; Indocyanine green; Paraaortic lymph nodes; Medicine,endometrial neoplasms; lymphatic metastasis; sentinel lymph node,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Coloring Agents; Endometrial Neoplasms/pathology; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Indocyanine Green; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Retrospective Studies; Sentinel Lymph Node/pathology; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy/methods",Coloring Agents; Indocyanine Green,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/early/2019/12/18/ijgc-2019-000847?rss=1 https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/30/3/299.full.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31857440 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31857440/ https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/30/3/299,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2019-000847,31857440,10.1136/ijgc-2019-000847,2983926105,,0,002-654-353-590-946; 005-739-356-121-143; 008-365-966-586-285; 011-975-581-084-694; 015-724-981-439-588; 022-445-889-244-579; 023-870-085-981-788; 026-529-487-911-651; 031-414-158-140-869; 039-352-014-250-663; 044-553-238-011-76X; 047-557-096-882-566; 050-201-395-649-140; 057-790-501-506-665; 062-590-361-803-821; 068-712-725-476-771; 093-660-706-532-373; 109-182-903-112-664; 132-481-816-891-640,9,false,,

People who have Lynch syndrome are strongly predisposed to develop colorectal cancer as well as several other types of cancer. The aim of this study was to explore features of ovarian cancers arising in families with Lynch syndrome. This study was a case report based on family history examining three patients with a new diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma with ovarian cancer. Family members of carriers of the mutations were counseled, and those found to be at risk were offered mutation testing. The clinical criteria of the Amsterdam II guidelines for Lynch syndrome were used in this study. This is a maternal history of a 27-year-old woman sharing the destiny of her 48-year-old mother and 45-year-old aunt, both of which were suffering from Lynch syndrome associated with ovarian cancer. The maternal grandmother and maternal uncle of this young woman also suffered from colon cancer in their forties.

The aim of this study was to develop a robust model allowing for individualised surveillance based on a patient's risk profile. Methods Data of 4343 early-stage patients with cervical cancer treated between 2007 and 2016 were obtained from the international SCCAN (Surveillance in Cervical Cancer) consortium. The Cox proportional hazards model predicting disease-free survival (DFS) was developed and internally validated. The risk score, derived from regression coefficients of the model, stratified the cohort into significantly distinctive risk groups. On its basis, the annual recurrence risk model (ARRM) was calculated. Results Five variables were included in the prognostic model: maximal pathologic tumour diameter; tumour histotype; grade; number of positive pelvic lymph nodes; and lymphovascular space invasion. Five risk groups significantly differing in prognosis were identified with a five-year DFS of 97.5%, 94.7%, 85.2% and 63.3% in increasing risk groups, whereas a two-year DFS in the highest risk group equalled 15.4%. Based on the ARRM, the annual recurrence risk in the lowest risk group was below 1% since the beginning of follow-up and declined below 1% at years three, four and >5 in the medium-risk groups. In the whole cohort, 26% of recurrences appeared at the first year of the follow-up, 48% by year two and 78% by year five. Conclusion The ARRM represents a potent tool for tailoring the surveillance strategy in early-stage patients with cervical cancer based on the patient's risk status and respective annual recurrence risk. It can easily be used in routine clinical settings internationally.",158,,111,122,Framingham Risk Score; Internal medicine; Cervical cancer; Risk groups; Prognostic model; Recurrence risk; In patient; Proportional hazards model; Medicine; Cohort,Annual recurrence risk; Cervical cancer; Prognostic model; Surveillance,,,NCI NIH HHS (P30 CA008748) United States,https://www.muni.cz/vyzkum/publikace/1804601 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:fd09ea9 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804921006031,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.09.008,34666213,10.1016/j.ejca.2021.09.008,3207777424,PMC9406128,0,000-532-314-658-524; 002-164-490-061-010; 012-090-396-529-290; 013-847-256-192-655; 014-561-400-779-913; 017-488-059-578-595; 019-460-169-572-133; 026-891-395-192-997; 027-741-324-571-204; 035-518-536-371-536; 036-568-776-317-127; 037-825-942-849-876; 038-672-235-232-190; 044-997-540-176-925; 048-892-217-424-25X; 052-655-817-219-95X; 054-249-370-971-553; 060-707-460-224-677; 065-151-847-639-632; 070-062-242-819-450; 089-463-084-520-388; 091-283-280-824-163; 092-898-014-357-694; 100-299-378-921-894; 104-975-542-943-750; 105-537-856-757-703; 108-282-065-961-270; 113-475-906-579-909; 123-126-108-399-193; 138-605-774-894-834; 193-766-513-248-422,28,true,,unknown

Six significant variables were identified in the multivariable analysis and were used to construct the prognostic model. Two were related to primary treatment (largest tumour size and lymphovascular space invasion) and four to recurrence (DFI1, age at recurrence, presence of symptoms, and recurrence type). The C-statistic after 10-fold cross-validation of prognostic model reached 0.701 (95% CI 0.675-0.727).

Patient History A 26-year-old woman had a diagnosis of cervical clear cell carcinoma, which was International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB1, at 18 weeks of gestation during a triplet pregnancy. Owing to the patient’s strong desire for full-term pregnancy, 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered after magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the tumor. The patient underwent cesarean delivery and radical hysterectomy at gestational week 32. The hysterectomy specimen revealed stage IB1 clear cell adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The neonates and the mother did not have any complications related to the treatment during 36 months of follow-up. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a triplet pregnancy complicated by cervical clear cell carcinoma that was successfully treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cesarean radical hysterectomy. Our experience and literature review suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for cervical carcinoma diagnosed during pregnancy is associated with excellent oncologic and fetal outcome; therefore, it may be considered as a temporary fertility-sparing approach in selected patients with a strong desire for full-term pregnancy.

A total of 169 patients were allocated into 5 groups, comprising the EIN-p group: 62 patients with an endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia lesion within an endometrial polyp, EC group: 17 patients with an endometrial carcinoma, EP-h group: 30 patients with hyperplasia on the background of the polyp but no atypia, EP group: 30 patients with endometrial polyps, and NE group: 30 patients with a normal (proliferative) endometrium. P53, PTEN, and KISS1 expressions between the groups were evaluated.; Results: In the EIN-p and EC groups, P53 and KISS1 expressions were moderate or strong. In the NE, EP and EP-h groups, KISS1 was weakly stained and P53 expression was negative. The number of patients with strong p53 and KISS1 expressions in the EC group was higher and this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001).

We performed a multicenter, retrospective review to identify patients with stage III MOC at seven gynecologic oncology departments in Turkey. Eighty-one women with MOC were included. Each case was matched to two women with stage III serous EOC in terms of age, tumor grade, substage of disease, and extent of residual disease. Survival estimates were measured using Kaplan-Meier plots. Variables predictive of outcome were analyzed using Cox regression models. With a median follow-up of 54 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) for women with stage III MOC was 18.0 months (95% CI; 13.8–22.1, SE: 2.13) compared to 29.0 months (95% CI; 24.04–33.95, SE: 2.52) in the serous group (p = 0.19). The 5-year overall survival rate of the MOC group was significantly lower than that of the serous EOC group (44.9% vs. 66.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). For the entire cohort, presence of multiple peritoneal implants (Hazard ratio [HR] 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38–4.14, p = 0.002) and mucinous histology (HR 2.28; 95% CI, 1.53–3.40, p < 0.001) were identified as independent predictors of decreased OS.

METHODS A multicenter department database review was performed to identify patients who had been operated and diagnosed with stage II EEC at seven centers in Turkey retrospectively. Demographic, clinicopathological, and survival data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS We identified 284 women with stage II EEC. There were 170 (59.9%) patients in the adequate lymph node dissection (LND) group and 114 (40.1%) in the inadequate LND group. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of the inadequate LND group was significantly lower than that of the adequate LND group (84.1% vs. 89.1%, respectively; p = 0.028). In multivariate analysis, presence of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-4.63; p = 0.009), age ≥ 60 (HR: 3.30, 95% CI: 1.65-6.57; p = 0.001], and absence of adjuvant therapy (HR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.40-5.35; p = 0.003) remained as independent risk factors for decreased 5-year disease-free survival (DFS). Inadequate LND (HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.18-4.63; p < 0.001), age ≥ 60 (HR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.25-5.72; p = 0.011), and absence of adjuvant therapy (HR: 4.95, 95% CI: 2.28-10.73; p < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors for decreased 5-year OS in multivariate analysis.

Pelin Kara; Ali Ayhan; Biray Caner; Murat Gultekin; Omer Ugur; M. Fani Bozkurt; Alp Usubutun; Aysegul Uner,"Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the immune response in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) of patients with endometrial and patients with cervical cancers by analyzing the number of S-100-, CD1a-, CD83-positive (+) dendritic cells that are the major antigen-presenting cells. Methods: A total of 56 patients with early-stage cancer (n = 32, with cervical; n = 24, with endometrial cancer) underwent SLN biopsy. Sentinel lymph nodes and non-SLNs were stained with antibodies against S-100, CD1a, and CD83 as markers for dendritic cells to find out whether SLNs were immunomodulated compared with non-SLNs. Results: The mean values of S-100(+) and CD1a(+) dendritic cells in both the tumor-free and the metastatic SLNs were significantly higher than those of both the tumor-free and the metastatic non-SLNs. When metastatic SLNs were compared with nonmetastatic SLNs, CD83(+) dendritic cells were found significantly more abundant in nonmetastatic SLNs. Conclusions: Significantly higher numbers of S-100(+) and CD1a(+) dendritic cells in the SLNs compared with those in the non-SLNs may indicate that SLNs are the first sites of immunostimulation. Immunosupression may be the underlying factor for the metastatic involvement of SLNs, which might be secondary to the significantly decreased number of mature dendritic cells in metastatic SLNs compared with tumor-free SLNs.",19,7,1239,1243,Cancer; Pathology; Antigen; Antibody; Biopsy; Endometrial cancer; Lymph; Lymphatic metastasis; Medicine; Immune system,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antigens, CD/metabolism; Antigens, CD1/metabolism; Carcinoma/immunology; Cell Count; Dendritic Cells/metabolism; Endometrial Neoplasms/immunology; Female; Humans; Immune Tolerance/immunology; Immunoglobulins/metabolism; Lymph Nodes/metabolism; Lymphatic Metastasis; Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; S100 Proteins/metabolism; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/immunology; CD83 Antigen","Antigens, CD; Antigens, CD1; CD1a antigen; Immunoglobulins; Membrane Glycoproteins; S100 Proteins",,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/19823061 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19823061 https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/19/7/1239-1243 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19823061/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/igc.0b013e3181b3e616,19823061,10.1111/igc.0b013e3181b3e616,2334788859,,0,008-829-554-164-062; 015-936-095-443-974; 022-764-224-468-875; 028-817-013-310-650; 033-566-468-229-08X; 037-587-157-761-19X; 041-110-216-089-134; 050-142-344-923-130; 051-932-150-366-076; 062-127-186-985-028; 062-707-343-394-709; 063-861-462-948-067; 077-863-496-349-625; 081-956-540-914-896; 104-973-982-396-691; 107-715-040-774-318; 117-869-431-586-300; 121-079-933-877-077,14,false,,

Aksan; Polat Dursun; Nasuh Utku Dogan; K Yuce; Ali Ayhan,"Objective; To evaluate the impact of tertiary cytoreductive surgery (TCS) on patient survival and to determine predictors of optimal TCS.; ; Methods; Twenty patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma who had TCS at Hacettepe University Hospital during 1992–2004 were retrospectively reviewed.; ; Results; Tertiary cytoreductive attempt was successful (optimal defined as <2 cm residual) in 12 patients and suboptimal in the remaining eight patients. Seven patients had no macroscopic residual, five patients had <2 cm gross residual and remaining 8 patients had ≥2 cm gross residual disease. Of these alive patients, 10 patients were alive with metastatic disease and only three patients were alive without any evidence of disease. Three patients had operative morbidity (15%), all of which were mild-moderate degree. Multivariate analysis could not differentiate a unique significant factor to have a possible predictor effect of optimal TCS. Multivariate survival analysis also could not differentiate any factor to have significant effect upon patient survival, neither the outcomes of primary, secondary or tertiary cytoreductive surgeries nor the usage of preoperative or postoperative chemotherapies.; ; Conclusion; TCS may not be helpful for patient survival. Neither of the clinical factors predicted an optimal TCS. Further larger series are needed for a definite conclusion. J. Surg.

McNeish; R Madry; Ali Ayhan; Kosei Hasegawa; Xiaohua Wu; Lea Dutta; C. Xu; Stephen Michael Keefe; J. Lee; Sandro Pignata,"Background Prognosis and OS are poor in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC). First-line standard of care for these patients is paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy; however, more effective and tolerable therapies are needed. In the phase 1b/2 trial KEYNOTE-146, which assessed the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab combined with the multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib, an ORR of 38% was observed in patients with previously treated advanced EC. ENGOT-en9/LEAP-001 (NCT03884101) is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, phase 3 study investigating pembrolizumab + lenvatinib vs chemotherapy in patients with EC. Trial design Patients with newly diagnosed advanced (stage III-IV) or recurrent EC not previously treated with antiangiogenic agents; systemic chemotherapy (unless within a chemoradiation regimen); PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 inhibitors; or other T-cell receptor–targeted therapies will be eligible. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W + lenvatinib 20 mg daily or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 Q3W + carboplatin AUC 6 Q3W. Randomization will be stratified by proficient vs deficient mismatch repair (pMMR vs dMMR) status. The pMMR population will be further stratified by prior chemoradiation (yes/no), measurable disease (yes/no), and ECOG performance status (0/1). Patients will receive treatment for ≤35 cycles of pembrolizumab vs 7 cycles of chemotherapy or until initiation of a new anticancer treatment, unacceptable AEs, or withdrawal of consent. Primary endpoints are PFS (per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review) and OS. Secondary endpoints are ORR, health-related QOL, safety/tolerability, and lenvatinib pharmacokinetics. Exploratory endpoints are disease control rate, clinical benefit rate, and duration of response.

METHODS A total of 285 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma who had undergone primary cytoreductive surgery including appendectomy were retrospectively evaluated. Appendiceal involvement was divided into 2 groups: gross and microscopic. Clinicopathologic variables were evaluated for possible significance in terms of appendiceal metastasis. A second analysis was performed using the same variables to detect a possible relation with microscopic metastasis. In a subgroup analysis, we also analyzed the role of routine appendectomy in patients with clinically early stage disease. RESULTS One-hundred six patients were found to have appendiceal metastasis (37%). Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed stage of disease as the unique factor determining the appendiceal metastasis (P < .001). Five patients with apparently stage I-II disease were upstaged due to isolated appendiceal metastasis (4.9%). In the second analysis excluding the patients with gross involvement, ascites was an independent predictor of microscopic involvement (P < .01). CONCLUSION Routine appendectomy is indicated in all epithelial ovarian carcinoma patients as part of the initial surgical staging procedure because of a considerable rate of upstaging in early stage disease and optimal cytoreduction in advanced stages.

METHODS A multicenter, retrospective department database review was performed to identify patients with recurrent ""low-risk EC"" (patients having less than 50% myometrial invasion [MMI] with grade 1 or 2 endometrioid EC) at 10 gynecologic oncology centers in Turkey. Demographic, clinicopathological, and survival data were collected. RESULTS We identified 67 patients who developed recurrence of their EC after initially being diagnosed and treated for low-risk EC. For the entire study cohort, the median time to recurrence (TTR) was 23 months (95% confidence interval [CI]=11.5-34.5; standard error [SE]=5.8) and the median OSFR was 59 months (95% CI=12.7-105.2; SE=23.5). We observed 32 (47.8%) isolated vaginal recurrences, 6 (9%) nodal failures, 19 (28.4%) peritoneal failures, and 10 (14.9%) hematogenous disseminations. Overall, 45 relapses (67.2%) were loco-regional whereas 22 (32.8%) were extrapelvic. According to the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Trial-99, 7 (10.4%) out of 67 women with recurrent low-risk EC were qualified as high-intermediate risk (HIR). The 5-year OSFR rate was significantly higher for patients with TTR ≥36 months compared to those with TTR <36 months (74.3% compared to 33%, p=0.001). On multivariate analysis for OSFR, TTR <36 months (hazard ratio [HR]=8.46; 95% CI=1.65-43.36; p=0.010) and presence of HIR criteria (HR=4.62; 95% CI=1.69-12.58; p=0.003) were significant predictors.

Most of the patients have a good prognosis and there are limited factors that affect their survival. In the present study, we evaluated the p16 and p53 gene expressions of stage 1a EOC patients. Prognostic effects of these gene expressions, as well as those of other factors on short term survival were analyzed. Methods Our study included 29 patients. The specimens of the ovary with cancer were stained for p16 and p53. Gene expressions and other prognostic factors were evaluated. Results The median age of the patients was 51 years (27-84). The mean numbers of dissected pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes were 27 and 12, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 33.7±18.9 months. During this period, recurrence occurred in two patients. One of the patients had grade 2 mucinous carcinoma and died of the disease at month 12 after the recurrence occurred at month 7. The second patient had clear cell carcinoma and recurrence occurred at month 34. p16 and p53 gene expressions or other factors were not associated with overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival in the short term. The lower p16 positivity rate in the non-clear cell group was found to be statistically significant (P=0.003). Both p53 and p16 positivity rates were higher in the high-grade carcinoma. Conclusion The levels of none of the common prognostic factors, including those of p16 and p53 gene expression, were associated with the progression-free survival or OS of stage 1a in the short term.

027-872-289-338-043,Finite element analysis of semiconductor package debonding due to thermal cycling,,1997,,,,,,Ali Ayhan,"In this study, the problem of ""debonding""', which is a difficult issue due to various complex package configurations, material properties, different loading (thermal loading and moisture absorption) and constraint conditions, has been investigated. The finite element method was used both in two dimensions and three dimensions. In the analyses, deformation and stresses in the semiconductor package have been determined and fracture analysis for possible interface cracks has been performed. Some of the problems encountered in this area are real three dimensional problems (i.e., corner cracks). Other problems can be partially three dimenSIOnal (modeling of solder balls, etc.). There is also a need to employ three dimensional finite element analysis to decide on where and when two dimensional fInite element analysis can be used with confidence. Thus, in this study, Finite Element Analysis is performed by using a three dimensional fInite element approach, in terms of both stresses and fracture parameters. For this purpose, a three dimensional fInite element program was developed, and the theoretical aspects are given in this thesis. As a first step in understanding the behavior of semiconductor packages in 3-D, and to be able to make comparisons between the 2-D and 3-D results, an additional capability has been added to the three dimensional finite element program, ""Generalized Plane Strain"". Comparisons in terms of stresses and fracture parameters, have been made between the 2-D and 3-D analyses. These results showed, that for the problems that are encountered in semiconductor packaging, one cannot make a general statement which defmes the relationship between 3-D (Generalized Plane Strain) analysis and 2-D calculations, i.e., it depends on the specillc package configuration, material properties and boundary conditions.",,,,,Finite element method; Boundary value problem; Integrated circuit packaging; Materials science; Semiconductor package; Plane stress; Material properties; Fracture (geology); Deformation (mechanics); Structural engineering,,,,,https://preserve.lehigh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1479&context=etd,https://preserve.lehigh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1479&context=etd,,,1586900960,,0,030-780-419-632-209; 047-980-140-341-993; 095-165-828-979-856; 099-507-346-713-070; 169-991-152-971-236,5,false,,

Sixth Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems (Cat. No.98CH36208),,IEEE,,Ali Ayhan; H. F. Nied,"The application of finite element models for the prediction of interface fracture parameters such as strain energy release rate and mixed mode stress intensity factors is examined in this paper. The comparison between fracture results obtained from 2D models and related 3D (generalized plane strain) calculations is of particular interest. These results show that for thermal cycling problems, one cannot anticipate 3D fracture results based on 2D calculations alone, i.e. plane stress, plane strain, and axisymmetric models. On the other hand, it is shown that the 2D models are quite adequate for modeling interface fracture in the case of pressure loading on the interface, e.g. pressure due to water vapor expansion during solder reflow. The fracture results presented in this paper were obtained using special enriched crack tip elements that contain the analytic asymptotic displacement and stress field. Issues concerning compatibility and convergence are shown to be important for accurate interface fracture calculations. Enriched crack tip elements for two and three dimensional elements are shown to provide highly accurate results for simulation of debonding in semiconductor packages subjected to thermal cycling and/or moisture absorption.",44,,185,192,Finite element method; Temperature cycling; Integrated circuit packaging; Materials science; Stress field; Plane stress; Strain energy release rate; Stress intensity factor; Mechanics; Fracture mechanics; Structural engineering,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/689539/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/itherm.1998.689539,,10.1109/itherm.1998.689539,2151292478,,0,005-810-246-442-682; 027-872-289-338-043; 035-342-865-119-52X; 047-980-140-341-993; 099-507-346-713-070,7,false,,

In multivariate analysis, elevated baseline serum CA 125 levels, deep myometrial invasion (MMI), adnexal involvement and positive peritoneal cytology were found to be independent risk factors for LN metastasis. In women without deep MMI and elevated baseline serum CA 125 levels, the rate of LN metastasis was 19%. The presence of solely deep MMI increased this probability up to 29.1%. The rate of LN metastasis was found to be 46.8% for women with both deep MMI and elevated baseline serum CA 125 levels.

Mean age was 47.6 years. The most common presenting symptom was abnormal uterine bleeding (53.7%). Endometrial pathology was detected in 51.2% of patients preoperatively. Seventy percent of patients were diagnosed at stage I, and 53.8% of patients received adjuvant treatment. Mean follow-up was 67.5 months. Overall 5-year and 10-year survival was 91% and 86%, respectively. Mean survival was 147.1 months. Recurrence rate was 11.2%. In univariate analysis, advanced stage, advanced age, residual disease after surgery, and need for adjuvant treatment were associated with disease-related mortality and advanced stage disease and absence of initial staging surgery were associated with disease recurrence. However, in multivariate analysis, only initial stage was found to be a significant prognostic factor. Conclusion: Initial stage seems to be the single most important prognostic factor in ovarian granulosa cell tumors. Therefore, a comprehensive staging surgery should be attempted to document the real extent of disease and to estimate the oncologic outcome more accurately.",20,3,158,163,Obstetrics and gynaecology; Internal medicine; Surgery; Univariate analysis; Stage (cooking); Granulosa cell; Ovary; Disease; Ovarian Granulosa Cell; Multivariate analysis; Medicine; Gastroenterology,Mortality; Ovarian granulosa cell tumors; Prognostic factors; Recurrence; Survival,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/108957454 https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2009.20.3.158 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2757560/ https://www.ejgo.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/1114JGO/jgo-20-158.pdf https://www.ejgo.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2009.20.3.158 https://www.komci.org/GSResult.php?RID=2173448&DT=1 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2757560 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Melih_Velipasaoglu/publication/26876492_Prognostic_factors_in_adult_granulosa_cell_tumors_of_the_ovary_a_retrospective_analysis_of_80_cases/links/549204170cf2ac83c53dbd81.pdf https://synapse.koreamed.org/upload/SynapseData/PDFData/1114jgo/jgo-20-158.pdf http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=KPSPBY_2009_v20n3_158,http://dx.doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2009.20.3.158,19809549,10.3802/jgo.2009.20.3.158,2131118910,PMC2757560,0,002-442-439-586-791; 011-618-428-545-364; 029-879-077-786-500; 031-634-119-726-685; 034-376-239-779-466; 037-063-421-098-757; 058-914-135-193-598; 060-758-419-585-681; 066-242-321-149-890; 070-112-263-350-711; 093-875-852-943-064; 135-321-872-882-075; 168-136-421-355-404,97,true,cc-by-nc,gold

However, the researches performed in the last two decades have begun to discuss about the safety of these drugs and the risks associated with their use. Especially, the potential neoplastic effects of these drugs are increasingly questioned. The studies have discussed whether there is an association between the exposure to ovulation-inducing drugs and the incidence of various cancers. Moreover, several studies have been performed to reveal whether there is an increased risk of childhood cancers in children conceived after fertility treatment. The point we reached through the available data is that the risk of breast, uterine and invasive ovarian cancers is not increased, but the risk of borderline ovarian tumors might increase after such a therapy. The risk of cancer has been found similar for children conceived after fertility treatment and those conceived naturally. It should also be kept in mind that cancers are overdiagnosed in infertile women population because of the close medical surveillance, which may also contribute to the early detection of cancers.

STUDY DESIGN Between January 2002 and August 2013, a total of 684 patients were included in the study. Frozen section diagnosis was compared with the final paraffin section diagnosis as the gold standard. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of frozen-section diagnosis were calculated for benign, borderline and malignant tumours. Clinicopathological parameters influenced by misdiagnosis were evaluated performing multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The overall accuracy was detected as 96.1%. Frozen-section diagnoses of 26 patients (3.8%) showed discordance. The specificity (99.7%) and PPV (99.4%) of frozen-section diagnosis was highest in the malignant category. In BOTs, diagnostic agreement was observed in 57 of 70 (81.4%) cases. The PPV (81.4%) was lowest for these patients. Tumour diameter of ≥10 cm (OR [95% CI]= 3.0 [1.1 to 8.2]; P=0.030) and mucinous histology (OR [95% CI]= 2.5 [1.0 to 6.2]; P=0.042) were significant predictors of misdiagnosis. With the increase in the number of sections, the accuracy rate of frozen section diagnosis was decreased. While not statistically significant (p=0.361). CONCLUSION The number of sections is increased parallel to increase in tumor diameters. On the contrary, the diagnostic accuracy was no significantly increased with an increase in the number of sections. This discrepancy may be associated with falling tumor size per frozen section. A prospective study based on a certain tumour diameter per frozen section may better demonstrate the positive effect of the number of sections.",11,4,245,250,Logistic regression; Prospective cohort study; Frozen Section Diagnosis; Nuclear medicine; Gold standard (test); Medical diagnosis; Positive predicative value; Histology; Medicine; Frozen section procedure,frozen section diagnosis; number of sections; ovarian tumors; tumour diameter,Diagnostic Errors; Female; Frozen Sections/methods; Histocytological Preparation Techniques/methods; Humans; Middle Aged; Ovarian Neoplasms/diagnosis; Paraffin Embedding/methods; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27849334,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27849334,27849334,,2588526896,,0,,7,false,,

Methods We retrospectively evaluated ovarian cancer patients who underwent HIPEC following complete cytoreductive surgery performed during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in three different centers specializing in gynecological oncology. All patients who underwent cytoreduction plus HIPEC for a primary, interval, and recurrent surgery were evaluated. Primary outcomes was postoperative 30-day morbidity and mortality. The secondary outcome was infection of patient and/or related staff with COVID-19 during the perioperative or early postoperative period. Results We performed a total of 35 HIPEC procedures during the pandemic: 15 (42.9%) patients underwent primary/interval surgery, while 20 (57.1%) patients had recurrent disease. Grade 3–4 complications occurred in one patient (2.9%) (chronic renal failure), while mortality did not occur in any patient. Neither the patients nor related staff were infected with the coronavirus during the perioperative or early postoperative period. One patient, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia on postoperative day 80 died from the infection. Another patient died on postoperative day 85 due to progressive ovarian cancer, a disorder in vital functions, and organ failure. Conclusion HIPEC during the COVID-19 pandemic seems a safe and feasible procedure, with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Careful selection of patients is important and precautions should be taken before the procedure.",31,6,883,887,Surgery; Mortality rate; Pneumonia; Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy; Ovarian cancer; Chronic renal failure; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Perioperative; Medicine; Pandemic,COVID-19; gynecologic surgical procedures; ovarian neoplasms,Adult; Aged; COVID-19/epidemiology; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy/methods; Middle Aged; Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2/isolation & purification,,,http://ijgc.bmj.com/content/31/6/883 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33858953 https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/31/6/883 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33858953/ https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2021-002511 http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2021-002511 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8054827 https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/early/2021/04/14/ijgc-2021-002511.full.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33858953,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2021-002511,33858953,10.1136/ijgc-2021-002511,3153565575,,0,001-407-423-070-678; 003-225-851-279-713; 009-724-901-021-505; 012-312-834-847-872; 014-827-770-678-058; 016-496-738-922-478; 019-168-055-398-271; 022-934-653-724-004; 024-119-535-892-578; 024-754-431-473-531; 033-138-382-891-08X; 035-183-622-803-989; 061-458-749-935-447; 064-496-184-052-271; 066-465-488-319-722; 068-706-695-584-112; 070-584-771-709-765; 073-126-986-189-657; 080-725-462-081-272; 084-838-215-436-212; 103-659-893-124-545; 113-197-643-757-808; 150-125-458-555-605,2,true,,green

Changes from baseline to week 36 in QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) and physical functioning (PF) and QLQ-CX24 symptom-experience scale were secondary endpoints. Other PRO analyses were exploratory endpoints. PROs were classified as improved based on a ≥10-point change (QLQ-C30, QLQ-CX24) or ≥7-pt change (EQ-5D-5L). No alpha was assigned to PRO analyses. <h3>Results</h3> Of 1060 patients in the intent-to-treat population, 1008 were included in PRO analyses (pembrolizumab+CCRT, n=502; placebo+CCRT, n=506). In both arms, QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL and QLQ-C30 PF and EQ-5D-5L VAS scores decreased from baseline at weeks 3 and 6 but improved relative to baseline at week 12 and subsequent weeks. A similar proportion of patients had improved/stable scores for the QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL (75.7% vs. 75.3%), QLQ-C30 PF (76.5% vs. 76.5%), QLQ-CX24 symptom experience (84.7% vs. 85.1%) and EQ-5D-5L VAS (73.3% vs. 75.6%) in both arms. There were no clinically meaningful between-group differences in changes in PRO scores from baseline to week 36 for QLQ-C30 GHS/QoL, QLQ-C30 PF, QLQ-CX24 symptom experience, or EQ-5D-5L VAS (table 1). <h3>Conclusion</h3> Improvement in PFS with addition of pembrolizumab to CCRT in patients with high-risk LACC was accompanied by QoL changes similar to those in the placebo+CCRT group. These results support pembrolizumab+CCRT as a new standard of care for patients with high-risk LACC and support the positive benefit-risk profile of this combination. <h3>Disclosures</h3> Disclosures are provided via the ESGO COI Disclosure form.",,,A42,A42,Pembrolizumab; Placebo; Medicine; Internal medicine; Cancer; Alternative medicine; Pathology; Immunotherapy,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2024-esgo.53,,10.1136/ijgc-2024-esgo.53,,,0,,0,false,,

METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 37 consecutive patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who underwent primary surgical treatment. In addition to platelet counts, all patients were evaluated with respect to age, gravida, parity, and stage and grade of tumor. Thirty-six patients had stage III, and 1 patient had stage IV disease. Optimal debulking (diameter of residual tumor, less than 1 cm) was performed in all patients who subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy (platin-paclitaxel). According to second-look laparotomy and follow-up results patients were divided into 2 groups. The first group had negative second-look laparotomy or no evidence of disease during follow-up (n = 20), and the second group had positive second-look laparotomy or progressive disease (n = 17). Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated for different cutoff values of platelet counts with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Age, gravida, and parity were not significantly different compared with controls (P >.05). Mean platelet counts were 371 x 10 9 /L and 446 x 10 9 /L in the first and second groups, respectively (P =.03). Different cutoff values of platelet counts for the diagnosis of thrombocytosis were evaluated. A cutoff value of 380 x 10 9 /L had sensitivity 77% and specificity 60% for recurrence, whereas a cutoff value of 400 x 10 9 /L had sensitivity 59% and specificity 65%. Area under the curve (± standard error) was 0.72 ± 0.08 (P =.026). CONCLUSION: In patients with progressive disease and positive second-look laparotomy, preoperative platelet counts were significantly higher compared with patients with no evidence of disease on follow-up.",103,1,82,85,Internal medicine; Surgery; Stage (cooking); Carcinoma; Progressive disease; Tumor progression; Thrombocytosis; Laparotomy; Receiver operating characteristic; Medicine; Area under the curve; Gastroenterology,,"Carcinoma, Endometrioid/blood; Cystadenocarcinoma, Papillary/blood; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Laparotomy; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood; Neoplasm Staging; Ovarian Neoplasms/blood; Platelet Count/standards; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; ROC Curve; Second-Look Surgery; Sensitivity and Specificity",,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14704249 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/14704249,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.aog.0000102703.21556.0b,14704249,10.1097/01.aog.0000102703.21556.0b,2316627511,,0,005-256-603-594-786; 008-445-707-637-391; 015-045-730-354-761; 017-823-080-140-067; 029-350-764-997-924; 037-278-039-698-290; 045-137-166-297-861; 052-612-235-015-076; 069-883-191-370-683; 072-684-228-875-797; 076-006-186-222-108; 095-297-752-191-409; 101-859-675-839-140; 108-161-859-103-250; 118-195-633-666-34X; 127-098-223-708-887; 158-543-035-126-123; 167-272-904-409-438,20,false,,

The objective of this study is to determine the basal knowledge of women regarding normal delivery (ND) and CD and also to assess their attitudes about CDMR, and to find out the reasons influencing those attitudes.Methods. The study included 400 women who completed a 45-item questionnaire that assessed their basal knowledge of ND, CD, and their attitudes and beliefs about the mode of delivery and CDMR.Results. Mean age of the study population was 32 ± 10.2 years (range 18–66). Majority of the women would choose the ND because of its ‘being completely natural’ (89%) and no anesthesia and operative risk related with ND (76%).

Primary tumors were endometrial (51), breast (27), colorectal (18), and stomach cancer (17), lymphoma (14), sarcoma of the uterus (13), undetermined (11), tumors of the appendix (6) and ileum (4), carcinoma of the cervix (4), and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (3). Overall 5-year and median survivals were 20.0% and 26.8 months, respectively. While worse prognoses were seen in gastric cancer and undetermined tumors followed by colorectal cancer, best survival figures were observed in endometrial cancer patients. A trend toward a better survival was seen with the advancement of the operation from bilateral salpingooophorectomy and/or biopsy to total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingooophorectomy, total omentectomy and pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy with debulking. Multivariate analysis identified the primary site, grade, laterality of involvement, type of surgery and adjuvant therapy status as significant prognostic parameters. Maximal surgical effort followed by adjuvant therapy might at least have short term survival benefit in certain types metastatic to the ovaries. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",60,4,268,276,Cancer; Internal medicine; Oncology; Endometrial cancer; Adjuvant therapy; Sarcoma; Metastasis; Stomach cancer; Debulking; Breast cancer; Medicine; Gastroenterology,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms/pathology; Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology; Endometrial Neoplasms/pathology; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Ovarian Neoplasms/mortality; Survival Rate",,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jso.2930600411 https://utsouthwestern.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/malignant-tumors-metastatic-to-the-ovaries https://europepmc.org/article/MED/8551738,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jso.2930600411,8551738,10.1002/jso.2930600411,1984241490,,0,004-199-698-416-629; 013-268-940-283-629; 020-723-479-799-170; 021-091-981-172-596; 025-696-102-967-673; 037-051-797-046-180; 042-202-174-156-216; 043-291-841-267-117; 057-054-347-034-27X; 064-945-455-999-418; 071-335-471-052-06X; 085-123-893-817-329; 093-418-364-868-030; 094-527-319-340-025; 101-376-072-574-490; 104-213-074-928-670; 107-849-607-997-63X; 118-950-115-471-258; 122-126-661-996-392; 128-101-217-760-399; 136-353-620-107-948; 142-028-294-611-601; 188-282-609-998-170,42,false,,

Aim To evaluate the sexual functions in women who underwent transobturator tape (TOT) surgery because of stress urinary incontinence and factors affecting the treatment results. Methods The study was conducted in 2 tertiary level clinics between 2013 and 2019 and included sexually active patients with a diagnosis of SUI who underwent TOT operation. The preoperative and postoperative (6 months after surgery) Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire short form (PISQ-12) scores of the patients were evaluated. The patients were evaluated according to the score changes of an increased score (benefited) and the same or lower score (did not benefit). The PISQ-12 questionnaire has 3 subdomains of behavioral-emotive (Q: 1–4), physical (Q: 5–9), and partner-related (Q: 10–12). Each question is scored from 0 to 4, giving a total ranging from 0 to 48. A higher PISQ-12 score indicates better sexual function. Main Outcome Measure PISQ-12. Results The study included 117 patients with a median age of 52 years (range, 32–67 years), and 51.3% of the patients were postmenopausal. When the preoperative and postoperative PISQ-12 scores were evaluated in the whole group, there was a statistically significant improvement (from 24.66 to 26.52, P = .001). In the analysis of domains, there was a statistically significant improvement in physical score (from 11.68 to 13.53, P  Conclusion Both physical and psychological statuses should be taken into consideration when planning treatment in patients with urinary incontinence, and it should be noted that postsurgical sexual function status may not be positively affected in postmenopausal, multiparous, and diabetic patients.

All of the patients received adjuvant chemoradiation after surgery. LNR was defined as the ratio of positive lymph nodes (LNs) to the total number of LNs removed. The patients were categorized as two groups according to LNR; LNR&lt;0.05 and LNR≥0.05. The prognostic value of LNR was investigated by univariate log-rank tests. <h3>Results</h3> Results: The median age of the patients was 50 (range, 25–81) years. Two hundred forty (71.6%) 95 (28.4%) patients were FIGO stage IIIC1 and IIIC2, respectively. There were 263 (78.5%) women with squamous cell carcinoma, 37 (11.0%) with adenocarcinoma, 28 (8.4%) with adenosquamous cell carcinoma, and 7 (2.1%) with other histologies. The median number of the harvested nodes was 39 (range, 5–138). The median number of removed pelvic lymph nodes was 28 (range, 1–97) whereas the corresponding figure 1 was 11 (range, 1–54) for para-aortic lymph nodes.

To investigate whether there is a correlation between serum tumor markers panel (CA 125, CA 19-9, CA 15-3, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)) and tumor size and histopathology in well staged patients with borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs). Methods. Four tumor markers (CA 125, CA 19-9, CA 15-3, and CEA) were analysed clinically in 60 well staged patients with borderline ovarian tumor, for this retrospective observational study. Results. Most patients had serous histology and early stage disease, and the mean age at the time of diagnosis was 40.70 years (range: 19–73). Twenty-nine patients (48.3%) had high CA 125 levels (>35 U/l), 15 patients (25%) had high levels of CEA (>4 ng/ml), 12 patients (20%) had high levels of CA 19-9 (>37 U/ml), and 9 patients (15%) had high levels of CA 15-3 (>30 ng/ml) at the time of initial surgery. The positive rate of CA 125, CA 19-9, CA 15-3, and CEA in serous tumor were 57.9, 7.9, 7.9 and 15.8%, respectively.

Between the years 2006 and 2016, a total of 22 early stage cervical cancer patients who underwent a fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy in our clinic were retrospectively analysed. The median age was 33 (range: 28-39) years. The median follow-up was 47 (range: 22-125) months. Five patients (22.7%) had Stage IA1, three patients had (13.6%) Stage IA2, and 14 patients (63.6%) had Stage IB1 disease. Only one patient had a recurrence. A pregnancy was obtained in five patients (22.7%) and one of them (20%) had a live birth. A pregnancy was obtained spontaneously in two patients (40%), whereas assisted reproductive techniques were used in three of the patients (60%). A miscarriage occurred in two patients (40%), and one of them was within the first trimester and the other was within the second trimester. Impact statement What is already known on the subject? Currently, the first-line treatment of early stage cervical cancer is surgery. However, a fertility-sparing trachelectomy is the most widely adopted approach in the reproductive aged patients who have a desire to be pregnant later. What does this study add? In the literature, there is a growing number of studies on this subject. However, it would take time to obtain adequate knowledge. We believe that our study would contribute to the existing data. What are the implication of these findings for clinical practice? This study is important as it indicates that a multidisciplinary approach is required to preserve fertility among gynaecologic oncologists and the outcomes would be reflected into the clinical practice. In addition, we believe that our study would pave the way for further studies regarding this subject among oncologists.",39,2,248,252,Obstetrics; Stage (cooking); Cervical cancer; Live birth; Oncofertility; Pregnancy; Miscarriage; Trachelectomy; Fertility; Medicine,Fertility-sparing; abdominal trachelectomy; cervical cancer; oncofertility,"Adenocarcinoma/surgery; Adult; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/surgery; Female; Humans; Organ Sparing Treatments/statistics & numerical data; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Rate; Retrospective Studies; Tertiary Care Centers/statistics & numerical data; Trachelectomy/methods; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/surgery",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371139 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443615.2018.1498830 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30371139/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2018.1498830,30371139,10.1080/01443615.2018.1498830,2898454137,,0,002-708-655-660-058; 005-377-116-734-13X; 006-511-842-258-511; 010-603-998-083-984; 015-532-321-216-796; 024-329-634-446-309; 024-710-866-822-249; 026-294-887-511-514; 028-516-750-879-303; 036-722-275-137-85X; 036-840-054-582-607; 037-804-935-076-446; 038-417-101-391-542; 043-292-975-751-371; 050-790-346-369-925; 057-002-214-323-102; 066-734-539-627-34X; 078-160-028-132-324; 079-752-504-272-295; 082-686-835-825-46X; 103-731-443-900-002; 109-750-026-538-147; 113-818-333-323-413; 124-476-957-992-262; 124-678-289-264-889; 136-568-471-499-762; 139-195-532-930-000; 150-063-567-774-160; 191-885-081-376-293,11,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC",gold

Carrier screening programs serve as preventive measures by identifying at-risk groups. This review examines the impact, implementation, advantages, and disadvantages of carrier screening, incorporating examples from ten countries: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Israel, China, Australia, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Data on carrier screening and related policies were collected from July to November 2022 and presented in a tabular format using a coding system devised by the authors. Variability was observed in the diseases/disorders and populations screened, screening expenses, and government provision across the countries. The number of diseases/disorders examined, ranging from 3 to 47, was determined by committee guidelines, government resources, pilot studies, and national institute resources. Notably, carrier screening programs exhibited greater worldwide inconsistency compared to newborn screening programs. The comparative analysis of developed countries serves to guide emerging nations. To address inequalities at both local and global levels, there is a need to enhance the establishment, development, and implementation of carrier screening programs. Furthermore, cost analyses of screening should be conducted, and adequate funding should be allocated to countries.

Stage 3 borderline ovarian lesions should be dealt with by the type of radical surgery reserved for frankly invasive ovarian cancer. The place of chemotherapy where the metastatic disease is histologically borderline in nature is still unclear although many would advocate its use. However when there is no evidence of spread beyond the ovary and the histology confirmed by an expert places the tumour in the borderline malignancy group, then no further therapy is indicated, even when the ovarian tumour is large. Alkylating agents used for chemotherapy have approximately a 10% long-term incidence of leukaemia and subsequent risk of death. There seems to be little point in having a classification of borderline malignancy if the patient is to be subjected to radical treatment in any case, even though the authors make the exception of the premenopausal patient who may wish to conceive. Proper staging at operation is important but it is also essential that the pathologist is an expert. In the Editors' experience there is usually only one or two such senior pathologists in any major city and usually pathologists are wise enough to make sure their local expert reviews the sections of all such cases.

It is unclear to what degree ERAS is implemented in hospitals globally. This international survey investigated the status of ERAS protocol implementation in open gynecologic oncology surgery to provide a worldwide perspective on peri-operative practice patterns. Methods Requests to participate in an online survey of ERAS practices were distributed via social media (WhatsApp, Twitter, and Social Link). The survey was active between January 15 and March 15, 2020. Additionally, four national gynecologic oncology societies agreed to distribute the study among their members. Respondents were requested to answer a 17-item questionnaire about their ERAS practice preferences in the pre-, intra-, and post-operative periods. Results Data from 454 respondents representing 62 countries were analyzed. Overall, 37% reported that ERAS was implemented at their institution. The regional distribution was: Europe 38%, Americas 33%, Asia 19%, and Africa 10%. ERAS gynecologic oncology guidelines were well adhered to (>80%) in the domains of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, early removal of urinary catheter after surgery, and early introduction of ambulation. Areas with poor adherence to the guidelines included the use of bowel preparation, adoption of modern fasting guidelines, carbohydrate loading, use of nasogastric tubes and peritoneal drains, intra-operative temperature monitoring, and early feeding. Conclusion This international survey of ERAS in open gynecologic oncology surgery shows that, while some practices are consistent with guideline recommendations, many practices contradict the established evidence. Efforts are required to decrease the variation in peri-operative care that exists in order to improve clinical outcomes for patients with gynecologic cancer globally.",30,10,1471,1478,Early feeding; Guideline; Gynecologic oncology; Urinary catheter; International survey; Enhanced recovery after surgery; Perioperative; Family medicine; Social media; Medicine,gynecologic surgical procedures; ovarian cancer; postoperative care; postoperative complications; surgical procedures  operative,"Attitude of Health Personnel; Enhanced Recovery After Surgery; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female/surgery; Guideline Adherence; Gynecologic Surgical Procedures/methods; Humans; Perioperative Care/methods; Prospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32753562/ https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/early/2020/08/28/ijgc-2020-001683.full.pdf https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/30/10/1471 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/enhanced-recovery-after-surgery-eras-in-gynecologic-oncology-an-international-survey-of-perioperative-practice(fa7ee732-623e-4c07-92f3-8b77ccc98101).html https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/793deb3c-604f-3af5-bbbc-a53c4558a931/ https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/30/10/1471.full.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32753562,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-001683,32753562,10.1136/ijgc-2020-001683,3047044861,,0,001-950-456-345-935; 007-195-338-580-047; 008-654-241-543-019; 010-085-585-679-643; 010-934-950-918-07X; 012-741-633-311-081; 015-237-272-624-571; 016-079-774-941-222; 024-197-903-567-917; 029-016-867-889-033; 032-560-668-775-196; 034-942-922-019-57X; 036-953-985-108-672; 038-241-974-773-359; 038-353-351-655-467; 040-661-068-779-41X; 040-872-517-722-452; 040-914-371-645-011; 045-419-283-909-295; 048-930-313-448-934; 049-097-080-605-271; 056-768-551-313-127; 057-285-914-192-820; 057-508-248-032-539; 062-256-947-089-799; 066-946-770-836-173; 070-834-358-686-474; 085-583-953-804-456; 093-467-473-680-230; 111-175-548-691-185; 114-914-677-754-854; 119-656-280-785-444; 122-254-501-985-316; 141-867-143-032-566; 147-653-419-433-315; 148-629-518-632-690; 152-904-135-724-860,54,true,,bronze

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of HPV DNA and to determine HPV types distribution among women with normal and abnormal cytology. A total of five hundred seven (n = 507) women were retrospectively evaluated between 2004-2008. Conventional polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of HPV types in cervicovaginal samples obtained from patients during gynecologic examination. One hundred four (n = 104) of the women were excluded from the study because of the incomplete data and a total of 403 women were used for the final analysis. There were, 93 (23%) women with cytologic abnormality and 310 (77%) women with normal cytology. Overall, 23% of the women was HPV positive. The overall prevalence of HPV in women with abnormal Pap smears was 36% (93/403), of which in ASCUS 22%, LSIL 51% and HSIL 60%. Also, HPV DNA was positive in 20% of the women with normal cervical cytology. The most common HPV types in cytologically normal women were as follows; HPV 16 (36%), HPV 6 (22%) and HPV 18 (13%). The rate of other HPV types were as follows; HPV11 4.4%, HPV45 4.4%, HPV90 4.4%, HPV35 2.2%, HPV67 2.2%, HPV81 2.2%, and multiple type HPVs 8.9%. The most common HPV types in cytologically abnormal women were HPV 16 (35%), HPV6 (19%) and HPV18 (8%). The rate of multiple HPV infections in women with normal Pap test was 2.2%. HPV prevalence and type distribution in this study were similar to that reported worldwide at least in our study population. Hovewer, HPV prevalence was more common compared with previous studies reported from Turkey. This might be related with methodology and hospital based patient accrual and high rate of women with abnormal cytology. Further population based prospective studies are needed to eliminate the drawbacks of our study and to determine nonhospital based HPV prevalence in Turkish women.",9,1,191,191,Ascus; Prospective cohort study; Papillomaviridae; Cervix; Pap test; Abnormal PAP Smear; Gynecology; Incidence (epidemiology); Population study; Medicine,,"Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Cervix Uteri/pathology; DNA, Viral/analysis; Female; Genotype; Humans; Middle Aged; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital/statistics & numerical data; Papanicolaou Test; Papillomaviridae/classification; Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Turkey/epidemiology; Uterine Cervical Diseases/epidemiology; Vaginal Smears; Young Adult","DNA, Viral",,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/19948015 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1471-2334-9-191.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103033845 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19948015 https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-9-191 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103033845.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2334-9-191/fulltext.html https://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/191/prepub https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1471-2334-9-191,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-9-191,19948015,10.1186/1471-2334-9-191,2005853839,PMC2789077,0,001-687-479-727-447; 004-286-264-321-951; 004-901-727-481-882; 009-534-160-120-145; 010-880-718-083-222; 014-929-072-952-651; 015-657-352-639-897; 020-874-811-152-60X; 022-297-524-852-975; 022-932-969-912-74X; 025-427-452-523-33X; 032-054-831-401-978; 034-494-144-433-38X; 036-153-550-697-96X; 038-048-893-390-386; 051-783-396-000-481; 054-185-145-667-918; 072-401-427-950-427; 114-296-196-510-634; 125-464-770-786-360; 127-361-685-439-103; 128-921-231-581-69X; 133-734-409-962-447; 137-609-052-578-938; 145-813-504-857-726; 148-889-145-114-954,77,true,"CC BY, CC0",gold

The digital archives of eight high-volume hospitals were studied for surgeries performed due to leiomyomas between January 2012 and January 2019, and leiomyosarcoma incidence was calculated based on the data obtained. Twenty-one patients in 3703 cases were found to have unexpected leiomyosarcoma, which means we can expect one leiomyosarcoma in 176 (0.56%) surgeries. Six more malignant tumours were detected among the remaining cases. Thus, our study estimated the incidence of unexpected leiomyosarcoma as 1/176 (0.56%), which is higher than most of the studies in the literature justifying the debate started by the FDA in 2014. As the tumour biology is not yet clear, and the incidence of unexpected leiomyosarcoma tends to be so high, the key focus must be to try to detect uterine leiomyosarcomas preoperatively for robust patient care.IMPACT STATEMENT<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> The incidence of unexpected leiomyosarcoma varies widely from 1/498 to 1/8300 depending on the study method and the type of procedure, and there is still controversy, even after the FDA statement that led to a major restriction in laparoscopic surgeries due to concerns about inadvertent morcellation of leiomyosarcomas.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> To the best of our knowledge, the current study found the highest incidence of unexpected leiomyosarcoma, and consequently a serious evaluation of all patients undergoing surgery due to leiomyomas preoperatively considering a leiomyosarcoma candidate is recommended.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> Studies on tumour biology and novel markers must be supported for accurate preoperative diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma.",42,6,2208,2212,Leiomyosarcoma; Medicine; Incidence (geometry); Turkish; Radiology; Obstetrics; Linguistics; Philosophy; Physics; Optics,Unexpected leiomyosarcoma; hysterectomy; incidence; morcellation; myomectomy,Female; Humans; Hysterectomy/methods; Incidence; Laparoscopy; Leiomyoma/diagnosis; Leiomyosarcoma/diagnosis; Morcellation; Retrospective Studies; Uterine Myomectomy/methods; Uterine Neoplasms/diagnosis,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2022.2036958,35253591,10.1080/01443615.2022.2036958,,,0,000-212-095-870-61X; 004-076-898-735-608; 012-740-652-849-827; 020-320-515-679-947; 027-314-963-239-527; 039-604-648-854-520; 067-734-963-264-249; 073-567-791-852-272; 075-296-736-266-204; 078-495-081-669-205; 089-662-978-339-272; 100-048-349-858-957; 113-085-110-222-433; 140-770-267-368-582,0,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC",gold

In this study we aimed to evaluate the progression free intervals after the secondline gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin treatments in this group. <h3>Methodology</h3> This is a descriptive retrospective study including 67 patients with recurrent high grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC) with partial platinum response. Partial response was defined as recurrence after 6 first-line therapies with platine derives in 6–12months. Patients who underwent gemcitabine + platine derives ± bevacizumab was defined as Group I and liposomal doxorubicin + platine derives ± bevacizumab as Group II. <h3>Results</h3> The median recurrence time of the whole group was 8 months. The mean initial recurrence times were 7.4±2.6 and 8.5±2.3 months for group I and II, respectively. The mean progression free survival time after in Group I and II were 13.6±6.1 and 13.7±19.7 months, (p:0.344), respectively. The estimated overall survival for groups were 59.0±7.2 months and 45.7±3.5 months but this was not statistically significant (p:0.135). <h3>Conclusion</h3> In our study, we found that progression free intervals after the secondline gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin treatments in patients recurrent high grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC) with partial platinum response are similar. This finding may support use of liposomal doxorubicin with longer treatment intervals and less hospital admission for the patient. <h3>Disclosures</h3> none",,,A331.2,A332,Gemcitabine; Medicine; Doxorubicin; Bevacizumab; Ovarian cancer; Internal medicine; Progression-free survival; Chemotherapy; Oncology; Serous fluid; Gastroenterology; Cancer,,,,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/33/Suppl_3/A331.2.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.695,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.695,,10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.695,,,0,,0,true,other-oa,hybrid

All of the patients received adjuvant chemoradiation after surgery. LNR was defined as the ratio of positive lymph nodes (LNs) to the total number of LNs removed. The patients were categorized into 2 groups according to LNR; LNR <0.05 and LNR ≥0.05. The prognostic value of LNR was evaluated with univariate log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regression models.; Results: A total of 138 patients (74.6%) had stage IIIC1 disease and 47 (25.4%) patients had stage IIIC2 disease. With a median follow-up period of 45.5 months (range 3-135 months), the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 62.5% whereas the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 70.4% for the entire study population. The 5-year DFS rates for LNR <0.05 and LNR ≥0.05 were 78.2%, and 48.4%, respectively (p<0.001). Additionally, the 5-year OS rates for LNR <0.05 and LNR ≥0.05 were 80.6%, and 61.2%, respectively (p=0.007). On multivariate analysis, LNR ≥0.05 was associated with a worse DFS (hazard ratio [HR]=2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.15-3.90; p=0.015) and OS (HR=1.95; 95% CI=1.01-3.77; p=0.046) in women with stage IIIC cervical cancer.; Conclusions: LNR ≥0.05 seems to be an independent prognostic factor for decreased DFS and OS in stage IIIC cervical carcinoma.",31,1,1,13,Survival analysis; Urology; Stage (cooking); Hazard ratio; Cervical cancer; Lymphadenectomy; Lymph node; Stage IIIC; Radical Hysterectomy; Medicine,Disease-Free Survival; Lymph Node Dissection; Lymph Nodes; Survival Analysis; Uterine Cervical Cancer,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers/analysis; Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Node Ratio/statistics & numerical data; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Middle Aged; Progression-Free Survival; Retrospective Studies; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality",Biomarkers,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31788991 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6918892 http://dspace.baskent.edu.tr/handle/11727/6294 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31788991 https://pc.ejgo.org/search.php?where=aview&id=10.3802/jgo.2020.31.e1&code=1114JGO&vmode=FULL http://acikerisim.baskent.edu.tr:8080/xmlui/handle/11727/6294 https://pc.ejgo.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/1114JGO/jgo-31-e1.pdf https://synapse.koreamed.org/upload/SynapseData/PDFData/1114jgo/jgo-31-e1.pdf https://www.ejgo.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2020.31.e1 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31788991/ http://kiss.kstudy.com/thesis/thesis-view.asp?key=3749620 https://synapse.koreamed.org/articles/1139003 https://www.ejgo.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/1114JGO/jgo-31-e1.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2020.31.e1,31788991,10.3802/jgo.2020.31.e1,2955034183,PMC6918892,0,001-035-438-734-09X; 003-883-926-934-378; 012-301-020-367-833; 016-009-000-122-502; 016-170-419-710-89X; 018-396-481-170-630; 018-471-261-491-341; 025-967-408-148-461; 026-418-820-268-240; 032-087-409-422-096; 034-322-325-289-742; 036-442-160-006-175; 038-124-694-012-78X; 039-848-743-549-285; 040-996-625-227-314; 044-468-933-787-328; 045-166-693-855-127; 046-858-391-702-049; 050-335-609-753-917; 065-286-907-753-321; 065-788-072-341-619; 074-361-808-659-94X; 078-830-163-370-501; 085-453-297-011-54X; 090-206-914-182-786; 099-035-781-808-354; 101-423-104-112-901; 105-479-470-765-951; 106-139-537-550-310; 118-707-418-655-345; 119-122-202-698-904; 158-265-078-277-231,36,true,cc-by-nc,gold

Using multicentric databases between January 2005 and January 2016, disease-free and overall survivals of 2745 endometrial cancer cases were compared according to the surgery route (laparotomy vs. laparoscopy). The high–intermediate- and high-risk patients were defined with respect to the 2016 ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO risk classification system, and they were analyzed with respect to differences in survival rates. Of the 2745 patients, 1743 (63.5%) were operated by laparotomy, and the remaining were operated with laparoscopy. The total numbers of high–intermediate- and high-risk endometrial cancer cases were 734 (45%) patients in the laparotomy group and 307 (30.7%) patients in the laparoscopy group. Disease-free and overall survivals were not statistically different when compared between laparoscopy and laparotomy groups in terms of low-, intermediate-, high–intermediate- and high-risk endometrial cancer. In conclusion, regardless of the endometrial cancer risk category, long-term oncological outcomes of the laparoscopic approach were found to be comparable to those treated with laparotomy.

Methods Databases from 13 participating centers in Turkey were searched retrospectively for women who had been treated for stage I-IV LGSOC between 1997 and 2018. Results Overall 191 eligible women were included. The median age at diagnosis was 49 years (range, 21-84 years). One hundred seventy-five (92%) patients underwent primary cytoreductive surgery. Complete and optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 148 (77.5%) and 33 (17.3%) patients, respectively. The median follow-up period was 44 months (range, 2-208 months). Multivariate analysis showed the presence of endometriosis (p = .012), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (p = .022), any residual disease (p = .023), and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage II-IV disease (p = .045) were negatively correlated with RFS while the only presence of residual disease (p = .002) and FIGO stage II-IV disease (p = .003) significantly decreased OS. Conclusions The maximal surgical effort is warranted for complete cytoreduction as achieving no residual disease is the single most important variable affecting the survival of patients with LGSOC. The prognostic role of LVSI and endometriosis should be evaluated by further studies as both of these parameters significantly affected RFS.",123,8,1801,1810,Internal medicine; Oncology; Serous fluid; Stage (cooking); Disease; Endometriosis; Gynecologic oncology; Lymphovascular; Ovarian carcinoma; Multivariate analysis; Medicine,cytoreductive surgery; endometriosis; low grade serous ovarian cancer; lymphovascular space invasion,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/mortality; Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Ovarian Neoplasms/mortality; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; Turkey; Young Adult",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33657253/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657253 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jso.26450 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33657253,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jso.26450,33657253,10.1002/jso.26450,3134430675,,0,002-203-999-281-314; 004-053-705-797-721; 006-322-651-872-92X; 006-370-411-876-039; 007-553-629-761-806; 014-872-150-577-224; 014-885-753-681-242; 014-951-949-943-585; 018-291-059-926-155; 020-792-392-731-121; 021-378-021-823-628; 021-553-197-459-001; 021-784-043-333-738; 022-492-407-803-916; 023-692-978-263-266; 031-888-631-419-190; 033-410-673-309-66X; 036-755-061-934-07X; 043-529-562-411-216; 054-728-266-998-631; 056-249-906-772-011; 059-308-306-855-477; 065-959-154-929-110; 070-340-818-332-205; 092-619-627-829-653; 097-543-519-319-991; 099-349-903-912-937; 099-536-989-384-082; 105-950-255-869-768; 139-000-201-679-621,5,false,,

The main outcome was prognostic factors for disease recurrence. The secondary outcomes were recurrence sites and obstetric results.; <bold>Methods:</bold> This study included patients diagnosed with BOT in Başkent University. Data was obtained from patient files and hospital records. Histopathological results were re-evaluated based on the new 2020 WHO classification. Risk factors for disease recurrence were evaluated for early-stage and advanced-stage diseases. Survival was measured from the time of diagnosis.; <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 142 patients were included. The median follow-up time was 100.5 months. Recurrence occurred in 24(16.9%) patients and the 5-year RFS 86.3% and no deaths were recorded. The main recurrence site of the tumor was the same ovary (12/24, 50%). In multivariate analysis, cystectomy was found as a risk factor for recurrence in the early stage (HR:4.28; 95%CI: 1.40 – 13.08, p:0.011). One patient’s tumor showed malignant transformation (1/24, 4.17%). The pregnancy rate was 76.7% among 43 patients who attempted to conceive. There was no difference in obstetric outcomes between USO and cystectomy (p:0.223).; <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The risk of recurrence in patients with BOT was higher in patients who underwent cystectomy and obstetric outcomes were similar between cystectomy and USO. In this study, most recurrences occurred in the ovaries. Therefore, fertility-sparing appears to be an appropriate choice for young women with satisfactory obstetric outcomes even in the advanced stage.</p>",,,,,Cystectomy; Medicine; Stage (stratigraphy); Multivariate analysis; Disease; Perioperative; Pregnancy; Gynecology; Internal medicine; Surgery; Cancer; Bladder cancer; Biology; Paleontology; Genetics,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4627979/latest.pdf https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4627979/v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4627979/v1,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-4627979/v1,,,0,000-967-303-379-282; 002-969-389-538-310; 007-718-399-394-539; 013-437-815-122-513; 015-331-287-026-698; 017-143-564-744-458; 018-517-280-192-794; 020-596-663-635-329; 027-781-465-486-747; 027-934-419-965-864; 028-442-397-565-944; 039-818-640-420-254; 044-953-333-492-445; 045-616-964-877-850; 078-159-322-769-010; 085-145-429-504-844; 085-213-690-887-908; 089-008-643-584-675; 092-319-162-888-981; 107-680-212-777-893; 115-650-102-451-967; 130-922-199-377-934; 130-956-033-654-386,0,true,cc-by,green

Zeyneloglu; Esra Kuscu; Ali Ayhan; Mehmet Haberal,"Background In this study, we aimed to determine the frequency of histopathologic outcomes of solid-organ transplantation in women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) receiving immunosuppressive therapies. Methods This is a retrospective study including a single-center experience. Data were extracted from hospital records, and solid-organ transplant recipients who were diagnosed with AUB were included. Results Fifty-five of these patients were renal transplant recipients (79.7%), and 14 were liver transplant recipients (20.3%). Histopathologic examination showed various histopathologic patterns of endometrium in patients with AUB consisting of normal histopathologic findings of endometrium in 31 patients (48.4%); 29 hormonal imbalance during proliferative and secretory phases of menstrual cycle and two atrophic endometrium. Endometrial hyperplasia without atypia was observed in 11 patients (17.2%). Polyp was seen in 22 patients (34.4%); 21 endometrial polyp and one endocervical polyp. There were significant differences in terms of histopathologic findings among the three groups of patients according to different immunosuppressive regimens (P = .029).

Seven patients among 50 cases of malignant gestational trophoblastic neoplasia were analyzed retrospectively in a single institution.Results. The mean age of the patients at diagnosis was 28.7 years (range: 20-34). While five of the patients presented initially with symptoms related to cranial involvement, the remaining two developed cerebral metastases during the therapy. In two patients, the presentation was so similar to a primary cranial pathology that craniotomy and biopsy revealed the trophoblastic involvement. The sites of involvement were the parietal lobe in three, temporal lobe in two and frontal lobe in two patients. Besides central nervous system involvement, four had additional lung and one had pelvic metastases. In terms of therapy, while five patients received methotrexate+actinomycin-D+cyclophosphamide regimen for 3 to 5 courses, only two could be admi...",75,6,548,550,Pathology; Biopsy; Frontal lobe; Parietal lobe; Craniotomy; Metastasis; Central nervous system disease; Temporal lobe; Medicine; Complication,,"Adult; Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage; Brain Neoplasms/secondary; Cause of Death; Clinical Protocols; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/pathology; Prognosis; Radiotherapy Dosage; Trophoblastic Tumor, Placental Site/pathology; Uterine Neoplasms/pathology",Antineoplastic Agents,,https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00016349609054669 https://avesis.ogu.edu.tr/yayin/0b1edefa-5e62-4247-8187-a8c3c74d5dce/central-nervous-system-involvement-in-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00016349609054669 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00016349609054669 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8693931 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3109/00016349609054669/abstract https://europepmc.org/article/MED/8693931,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/00016349609054669,8693931,10.3109/00016349609054669,2105685777,,0,021-631-834-623-275; 033-220-799-649-590; 060-339-529-774-444; 066-367-587-046-361; 073-987-932-520-804; 082-512-686-660-509; 083-474-487-582-351; 133-984-348-287-012; 159-441-864-328-469; 160-050-236-200-672,9,false,,

It has been most commonly used in vulvar and uterine cervivcal cancer in gynecological oncology. According to these studies, almost all of which are prospective, particularly in cases where Technetium-labeled nanocolloid is used, sentinel node detection rate sensitivity and specificity has been reported to be 100%, except for a few cases. In the studies on cervical cancer, sentinel node detection rates have been reported around 80–86%, a little lower than those in vulva cancer, and negative predictive value has been reported about 99%. It is relatively new in endometrial cancer, where its detection rate varies between 50 and 80%. Studies about vulvar melanoma and vaginal cancers are generally case reports. Although it has not been supported with multicenter randomized and controlled studies including larger case series, study results reported by various centers around the world are harmonious and mutually supportive particularly in vulva cancer, and cervix cancer. Even though it does not seem possible to replace the traditional approaches in these two cancers, it is still a serious alternative for the future. We believe that it is important to increase and support the studies that will strengthen the weaknesses of the method, among which there are detection of micrometastases and increasing detection rates, and render it usable in routine clinical practice.",6,1,53,53,Cancer; Internal medicine; Oncology; Sentinel node; Vulva; Endometrial cancer; Cervix; Cervical cancer; Surgical oncology; Vulvar melanoma; Medicine,,"Endometrial Neoplasms/pathology; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female/pathology; Humans; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Lymphatic Metastasis; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy/methods; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology; Vaginal Neoplasms/pathology; Vulvar Neoplasms/pathology",,,https://wjso.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477-7819-6-53 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2409335 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1477-7819-6-53/fulltext.html https://paperity.org/p/57845193/lymphatic-mapping-and-sentinel-node-biopsy-in-gynecological-cancers-a-critical-review-of https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1477-7819-6-53 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1477-7819-6-53.pdf https://doaj.org/article/00283799449b4dd199165601c46f5900,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1477-7819-6-53,18492253,10.1186/1477-7819-6-53,2108482510,PMC2409335,0,000-077-959-813-657; 001-312-474-145-279; 002-482-716-039-304; 004-838-454-005-418; 005-242-951-779-798; 005-863-446-682-137; 006-273-758-632-530; 008-440-497-793-720; 009-804-054-870-310; 010-254-873-341-086; 010-555-396-935-250; 013-352-950-504-319; 015-619-736-255-676; 016-150-001-811-281; 017-665-621-954-653; 020-707-360-962-516; 023-016-921-597-202; 023-578-122-793-48X; 026-444-197-851-715; 026-618-452-078-107; 028-643-100-985-245; 028-648-081-129-322; 028-817-013-310-650; 029-748-752-879-437; 029-913-990-876-887; 030-123-655-394-855; 031-059-091-167-085; 032-117-100-030-187; 032-879-757-444-983; 032-887-588-071-96X; 033-566-468-229-08X; 033-877-197-487-703; 035-296-543-495-560; 035-984-560-898-520; 036-902-770-104-869; 037-934-506-089-471; 041-095-860-226-504; 041-110-216-089-134; 042-239-980-441-926; 042-315-701-587-431; 043-233-131-768-763; 045-268-619-555-764; 045-769-562-661-464; 046-685-877-693-813; 048-281-536-388-089; 049-640-121-777-531; 049-926-721-863-867; 050-854-137-316-309; 051-780-820-882-409; 051-932-150-366-076; 056-841-013-593-692; 057-002-214-323-102; 058-017-385-996-369; 061-428-704-695-809; 062-748-526-873-180; 063-861-462-948-067; 066-721-481-984-500; 067-949-945-343-697; 068-152-909-821-231; 070-757-060-785-270; 075-645-956-661-946; 083-507-908-675-395; 084-071-410-834-864; 085-393-210-590-154; 087-157-048-835-464; 089-855-923-671-48X; 090-893-962-243-43X; 094-126-223-163-872; 096-994-748-756-390; 098-787-832-232-611; 099-216-771-367-754; 103-334-524-508-249; 104-973-982-396-691; 106-171-465-148-751; 107-715-040-774-318; 113-349-321-160-70X; 117-869-431-586-300; 119-725-655-539-554; 124-788-488-054-021; 127-880-664-552-478; 132-696-490-874-864; 139-954-428-215-968; 183-057-335-518-586,41,true,"CC BY, CC0",gold

Aksan; Alp Usubutun; Kunter Yuce,"Aim:  Depth of appendiceal metastasis in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) has not been previously analyzed for a possible relationship with clinico-pathological variables.; ; Methods:  Sixty-nine patients with EOC treated at Hacettepe University were retrospectively analyzed. All of the patients had appendiceal metastasis. Pathological slides were re-reviewed by the same pathologist. Appendiceal metastases were defined as serosal (if tumoral spread involved only serosa of the appendix) or sero-mucosal (if tumoral spread also involved either muscular or mucosal surfaces of the appendix). Univariate and multivariate analysis did not reveal a significant difference with respect to the prognostic variables between the groups.; ; Results:  Thirty-nine patients had serosal appendiceal metastasis (56.5%), while the remaining 30 patients (43.5%) had appendiceal metastasis extending toward the muscular layer (seromucosal metastasis: 16 within muscularis mucosa, 14 within the mucosa of the appendix). The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 54.58 years (range, 26-88 years), with no significant difference between the groups (P = 0.9). Comparison of the survival rates between the two groups did not reveal a significant difference. Three-year survival rates were 23.3% in the serosal metastasis and 27.9% in the seromucosal metastasis group (P = 0.9). This figure was 25% for patients with only muscular metastasis and 41.6% for patients with appendiceal metastasis extending to the mucosal layer (P = 0.2).; ; Conclusion:  This is the first report to analyze the metastatic pattern of EOC on the appendix with respect to depth of invasion which could not reveal a significant difference.",34,4,557,560,Internal medicine; Pathology; Prognostic variable; Retrospective cohort study; Pathological; Appendix; Muscularis mucosae; Muscular layer; Metastasis; Clinical significance; Medicine; Gastroenterology,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Appendiceal Neoplasms/secondary; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology; Retrospective Studies",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18937709 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1447-0756.2008.00816.x/abstract https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/10021930036 https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1447-0756.2008.00816.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1447-0756.2008.00816.x,18937709,10.1111/j.1447-0756.2008.00816.x,2035475583,,0,004-232-088-206-108; 009-849-994-620-054; 012-798-420-204-474; 016-426-349-472-203; 017-578-527-621-54X; 020-234-913-346-338; 020-462-246-387-033; 027-742-400-876-822; 029-924-807-441-687; 032-609-862-393-671; 055-118-456-216-141,2,false,,

We aimed to evaluate the survival impact of number of removed lymph nodes and their localizations in stage I EOC. This study included 182 patients. The best cut-off levels for number of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes (PaLN) were 24 and 10, respectively. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed for these cut-offs and other prognostic factors. The median age of the patients was 49. The median number of removed pelvic and paraartic lymph nodes were 29 and 9, respectively. The median overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 67 and 50 months, respectively. The 5-year OS rate was 89.6%. Recurrence occured in 24 (19.5%) patients. In univariate analyses tumor grade (p: 0.005), pelvic LN number (p: 0.041) and PaLN number (p: 0.004) were the factors that were significantly associated with PFS. Tumor grade and PaLN number were independently and significantly associated with PFS in multivariate analyses (p: 0.015 and p: 0.017, respectively). In OS analyses, age, tumor grade, presence of LVI, number of pelvic and PaLNs were the significantly associated factors (p < 0.05 for all). In multivariate analyses, age and PaLN number were independently and significantly associated with OS (p: 0.011 and p: 0.021, respectively). The number and localizations of removed lymph nodes may have a survival affect in stage I EOC. We also think that this study may constitute a kernel point for larger prospective series on lymph node number and lymphatic regions.",305,2,1,7,Urology; Univariate analysis; Lymphatic system; Lymph; Lymphadenectomy; Lymph node; Aortic lymph nodes; Epithelial ovarian cancer; Multivariate analysis; Medicine,Early stage; Epithelial ovarian cancer; Lymph node number; Lymphadenectomy; Survival,"Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial/pathology; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology; Neoplasm Staging; Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies",,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-369390/v1.pdf?c=1631898049000 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34410474/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00404-021-06190-9 https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-369390/v1 https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR350939,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00404-021-06190-9,34410474,10.1007/s00404-021-06190-9,3167810758,,0,000-547-124-532-148; 005-788-120-099-761; 006-554-717-789-399; 010-753-081-418-520; 014-882-918-662-362; 024-001-442-396-029; 028-770-657-194-055; 034-669-635-038-415; 035-438-854-075-134; 035-735-883-554-688; 043-715-792-648-082; 059-470-432-262-483; 071-156-970-266-317; 099-671-145-922-364; 102-915-439-387-20X; 135-575-979-305-366; 189-089-519-408-95X,1,true,cc-by,green

Bozkurt; Ali Ayhan; Mehmet F. Yaren; S. Siriç,"In this study, finite element modeling and experimental studies on a mode-I/III specimen similar to the compact tension specimen are presented. By using bolts, the specimen is attached to two loading apparatus that allow different levels of mode-I/III loading by changing the loading holes. Specimens having two different thicknesses are analyzed and tested. Modeling, meshing and the solution of the problem involving the whole assembly, i.e., loading devices, bolts and the specimen, with contact mechanics are performed using ANSYSTM. Then, the mode-I/III specimen is analyzed separately using a submodeling approach, in which threedimensional enriched finite elements are used in FRAC3D solver to calculate the resulting stress intensity factors along the crack front. In all of the analyses, it is clearly shown that although the loading is in the mode-I and III directions, mode-II stress intensity factors coupled with mode-III are also generated due to rotational relative deformations of crack surfaces. The results show that the mode-II stress intensity factors change sign along the crack front and their magnitudes are close to the mode-III stress intensity factors.

The method, which advantageously does not require special mesh configuration/modifications and post-processing of finite element results, is an enhancement of previous developments applied so far on isotropic homogeneous and isotropic interface cracks. The spatial variation of FGM material properties is taken into account at the level of element integration points. To validate the developed method, two- and three-dimensional mixed-mode fracture problems are selected from the literature for comparison. Two-dimensional cases include: inclined central crack in a large FGM medium under uniform tensile strain and stress loadings, a slanted crack in a finite-size FGM plate under exponentially varying tensile stress loading and an edge crack in a finite-size plate under shear traction load. The three-dimensional example models a deflected surface crack in a finite-size FGM plate under uniform tensile stress loading. Comparisons between current results and those from analytical and other numerical methods yield good agreement. Thus, it is concluded that the developed three-dimensional enriched finite elements are capable of accurately computing mixed-mode fracture parameters for cracks in FGMs.",46,3,796,810,Finite element method; Composite material; Isotropy; Materials science; Stress concentration; Material properties; Numerical analysis; Stress intensity factor; Structural engineering; Stress (mechanics); Shear (geology),,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82663123 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768308004046 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020768308004046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2008.09.026,,10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2008.09.026,1989323241,,0,000-819-947-862-902; 002-153-120-561-698; 004-371-141-865-357; 008-359-014-728-839; 010-395-214-522-341; 010-815-998-127-611; 013-446-936-859-583; 015-612-546-455-050; 019-643-651-157-001; 019-688-975-037-021; 023-334-222-693-004; 024-536-347-545-445; 024-988-938-756-110; 035-756-219-229-628; 037-578-324-647-569; 040-922-684-032-304; 041-123-717-023-304; 050-919-322-419-398; 056-225-747-198-692; 062-501-342-442-074; 066-851-301-835-176; 067-150-629-919-730; 067-169-914-516-498; 071-198-318-327-612; 076-613-056-683-007; 080-008-397-510-752; 084-826-917-595-877; 088-403-358-436-140; 091-866-296-747-89X; 094-291-296-999-549; 105-897-711-849-85X; 107-518-604-823-320; 116-696-103-012-237; 124-589-635-698-520; 129-145-292-858-805; 131-349-238-559-528; 134-183-713-301-510; 140-499-144-907-253; 143-288-581-514-932; 147-302-134-887-394; 148-144-295-855-858; 149-073-144-989-008; 186-702-758-510-63X,52,true,elsevier-specific: oa user license,unknown

Materials and methods A multicenter, retrospective department database review was performed to identify LVSI-positive patients with disease surgically confined to the uterus at two gynecologic oncology centers in Turkey. Demographic, clinicopathological and survival data were collected. Results We identified 185 LVSI-positivewomen with negative LNs during the study period. Fifty-five (29.7%) were classified as Stage IA, 94 (50.8%) as Stage IB, and 36 (19.5%) as Stage II. The median age at diagnosis was 59 years and the median duration of follow-up was 44 months. The total number of the recurrences was 12 (6.5%). We observed 5 (2.9%) loco-regional recurrences, 3 (1.5%) retroperitoneal failures, and 4 (2.0%) distant relapses. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 86.1% while the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 87.7%. Grade 3 histology (Hazard Ratio [HR] 2.9, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.02–8.50; p = 0.04), cervical stromal invasion (HR 4.5, 95% CI 1.61–12.79; p = 0.004) and age ≥ 60 years (HR 5.8, 95% CI 1.62–21.32; p = 0.007) were found to be independent prognostic factors for decreased OS. Adjuvant treatment did not appear as a prognostic factor for OS even in univariate analysis. Conclusion The recurrence rate among LVSI-positive endometrioid EC patients is low in the setting of negative LNs. However, one out of three patients with a recurrence experiences distant relapses which usually portend worse outcomes.",58,1,82,89,Internal medicine; Univariate analysis; Stage (cooking); Hazard ratio; Endometrial cancer; Gynecologic oncology; Stromal Invasion; Lymphovascular; Confidence interval; Medicine; Gastroenterology,Endometrial cancer; Endometrioid adenocarcinoma; Lymphovascular space invasion; Negative lymph nodes; Recurrence,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Endometrioid/pathology; Endometrial Neoplasms/pathology; Female; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology; Neoplasm Staging; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Turkey; Uterine Neoplasms; Uterus/pathology",,,http://acikerisim.baskent.edu.tr:8080/handle/11727/5471 http://dspace.baskent.edu.tr:8080/handle/11727/5471 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1028455918302900 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455918302900 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30638487,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tjog.2018.11.016,30638487,10.1016/j.tjog.2018.11.016,2909300499,,0,000-876-938-761-270; 003-580-647-011-126; 008-462-397-826-377; 010-244-466-570-51X; 011-024-502-430-699; 024-866-712-451-706; 027-744-709-016-897; 035-223-072-394-52X; 052-176-728-505-905; 052-413-686-241-732; 056-764-954-025-965; 058-606-587-817-555; 059-243-756-711-062; 059-930-786-718-577; 068-895-426-079-754; 076-672-587-045-792; 082-842-189-050-381; 088-019-192-264-29X; 092-629-011-855-246; 092-932-442-786-15X; 120-738-288-740-114; 124-678-289-264-889,9,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

This classification separates the ECAs as human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated (HPVA) and HPV-independent (HPVI) subtypes. According to WHO 2020, high risk (HR)-HPV association can be histologically recognized by the presence of luminal mitoses and apoptosis. Therefore, investigating the reproducibility of the morphologic criteria of this new classification will be important in observing the recognizability of tumor types. Full slide sets of 94 ECAs were collected from 4 institutions in Turkey and reclassified on the basis of IECC/WHO 2020 criteria and the presence or absence of HR-HPV. HR-HPV presence was confirmed by HPV DNA in situ hybridization, p16 immunohistochemistry and in conflicted cases with real time-polymerase chain reaction. The final diagnoses were given based on the combination of the histologic evaluation and ancillary test results. Our cohort was consisted of 73.4% HPVA and 26.6% HPVI cases. According to the WHO 2020 criteria 92.7% of HPVAs and 88% of HPVIs were easily classified. HPV DNA in situ hybridization was positive in 91.3% of the HPVAs and p16 was positive in all HPVAs, whereas was also positive in 8% of the HPVIs. In conclusion, most of the ECAs can be diagnosed by their characteristic morphologic features by the WHO 2020 criteria. However, we want to emphasize that mitosis/apoptosis criteria may not be helpful especially in mucinous ECAs and ancillary tests for HR-HPV should be used in challenging cases.",41,5,447,458,Correlation; Pathology; Endocervical Adenocarcinoma; Ancillary test; Human papillomavirus; Hpv testing; P16 immunohistochemistry; Medicine; Reproducibility; Immunohistochemistry; In situ hybridization; Polymerase chain reaction; Adenocarcinoma; Etiology; Cancer; Biology; Internal medicine; Gene; Gene expression; Biochemistry,,"Adenocarcinoma/pathology; Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis; Female; Humans; Papillomaviridae/genetics; Papillomavirus Infections; Reproducibility of Results; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology","Biomarkers, Tumor",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34856570,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/pgp.0000000000000839,34856570,10.1097/pgp.0000000000000839,3217461823,,0,002-148-147-910-636; 002-505-518-451-671; 010-072-691-360-81X; 010-493-517-882-167; 010-682-075-394-176; 012-272-024-217-752; 013-712-923-387-109; 015-450-595-209-869; 015-746-429-688-940; 023-357-646-924-074; 023-367-994-277-458; 023-835-282-385-674; 026-637-450-616-470; 030-887-935-194-452; 032-979-056-271-571; 035-089-446-808-527; 035-439-291-383-188; 039-862-097-641-415; 046-988-776-518-109; 048-753-726-806-440; 051-426-696-968-253; 054-458-742-692-565; 054-521-993-340-563; 055-692-587-446-656; 058-499-816-380-22X; 060-280-275-427-878; 064-343-584-486-952; 069-996-899-362-962; 076-613-402-152-98X; 078-410-235-954-485; 086-658-224-364-753; 089-459-322-582-874; 094-107-588-928-248; 095-189-467-476-853; 098-568-100-465-532; 110-402-418-294-107; 154-399-282-361-201,2,false,,

In an effort to apply and validate FCPAS procedures for multiple and non-planar crack propagation analyses, various problems are solved and the results are compared with data available in the literature. The method makes use of finite elements, specifically three-dimensional enriched elements to compute stress intensity factors (SIFs) without special meshing requirements. A fatigue crack propagation criterion, such as Paris-Erdo?an equation, is also used along with stress intensity factors to conduct the simulation. Finite element models are generated within ANSYS™ software, converted into and solved in FRAC3D program, which employs enriched crack tip elements. Having computed the SIFs for a given crack growth increment and using a growth criterion, the next incremental crack path is predicted and the fracture model is updated to reflect the non-planar crack growth. This procedure is repeated until cracks reach a desired length or when SIFs exceed the fracture toughness of the material. It is shown that FCPAS results are in good agreement with literature data in terms of SIFs, crack paths and crack growth life of the structure.

Early detection and administration of appropriate therapy is still a lifesaving procedure, especially for cervical cancer. The most common screening method for cervical cancer is still the cervical cytology (Pap-test). We aim to find out the advantages and disadvantages of a recently developed method, which is called as Polar Probe. Methods: Two different approaches had been used (conventional Pap test and Polar Probe), and 1438 patients were included in the study. Of these, 819 had been screened with Polar Probe. All eligible patients were firstly screened using Polar Probe and then using the Pap test. Each patient with an abnormal Polar Probe result was referred to colposcopy room, where she was re-evaluated using colposcopy. Results: The rate of abnormal smear result was 1.04%, and the corresponding percentage was calculated as 0.62% in LSIL, 0.34% in ASCUS, and 0.069% in HSIL. A total of 819 patients underwent Polar Probe, and the results were abnormal in 261 patients and normal in 558 patients. Abnormality rate was 1% in Pap test and 31.9% in Polar Probe. Although the positive predictive value was 27% for Polar Probe test and 16% for Pap test, as the colposcopy was indicated only for the patients with abnormal results in Polar Probe. The need for colposcopy dramatically increased with the use of Polar Probe. Conclusion: Use of Polar Probe alone was not found to be cost effective.

059-416-431-407-305,Coronary artery dissection during pregnancy,,2003,journal article,Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica,00016349; 16000412,Wiley,United Kingdom,Ibrahim Esinler; Nuray Yigit; Ali Ayhan; Sirri Kes; Kudret Aytemir; Tayfun Acil,"Acute myocardial infarction complicates approximately 1 per 10 000 pregnancies (1). It clearly causes an increment in both maternal (45%) and fetal mortality, especially reaching the highest levels in the third trimester (50%) (2). Obstructive and non-obstructive coronary arteriopaties are included in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction, and spontaneous coronary artery dissections, among the non-obstructive coronary arteriopaties, may play a role in very rare cases. The exact etiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissections is unknown. It mostly occurs in young healthy people, and can be associated with pregnancy or with the postpartum period. A case of acute myocardial infarction during the third trimester associated with spontaneous coronary artery dissection while using oral ritodrine for preterm labor is reported, and a computer-assisted literature review of this clinical entity is presented. A 24-year-old, gravida 2, para 1, 35 weeks pregnant woman was referred to our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology complaining of resting severe retrosternal chest pain and with the suspicious of an acute myocardial infarction. She had no known risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and no relatives with a history of coronary artery disease. Within the last week, she had being using oral ritodrine (Prepar 10 mg, 20 tb, Eczacibasi) 12 times a day (12 × 10 mg) for preterm labor, which had been prescribed by a previous hospital. She had a healthy female child, born in 1998 via a normal vaginal delivery, and she had no symptoms of coronary artery disease during her pregnancy. On admission to our delivery ward, electrocardiography and serum cardiac enzymes confirmed a diagnosis of a large Q-wave anterior acute myocardial infarction. Creatine kinase CK-MB isoform, troponin T and troponin I were 68.0 ng/mL (normal: 0.0–5.0 ng/mL), 6.7 ng/mL (normal: 0.0–0.1 ng/mL) and 42.1 ng/mL (normal: 0–1 ng/mL), respectively. Serum biochemistry and blood cell count were within a normal range. Vital sings were stable except for a minimal elevated heart rate (92 beats/min). We established maternal and fetal cardiac monitoring. Routine medical management of an acute myocardial infarction was then performed. Using pelvic examination, we exposed effective uterine contractions and a 4-cm cervical dilatation with 70% effacement. Fetal well-being parameters [non-stress text (NST), fetal estimated weight, biophysics profile] were normal. Continuous fetal and maternal monitoring were performed during the whole peripartum period, and 4 h after admission a 2900-g, healthy male infant was delivered via a normal vaginal delivery without any complications. A work-up was performed in order to find the etiology of the myocardial infarction after delivery. An echocardiography, which was undertaken on the same day of admission, revealed septal hypokinesia and a small aneurysm at the apex. No sign of valvular heart disease was obtained. One day later, a coronary artery angiography was undertaken and showed a proximal spiral-shaped left anterior descending artery (LAD) dissection (Fig. 1). A perfusion defect was found but as no sign of ischemia was found in the thallium-201 syntigraphy, which was performed 1 week after the coronary artery angiography, no intervention was considered necessary. Spiral-shaped dissection of the left anterior descending artery (black arrow) The patient was symptom free and discharged on the 12th day of her admission with her healthy baby. Acute myocardial infarction during the antepartum period is a rare phenomenon and complicates approximately 1 per 10 000 deliveries and causes an increase in both maternal and fetal mortality of up to 50%. From the first case described by Katz in 1922, up to 1996, 125 well-documented cases whose ages range from 16 to 45 have been presented in the literature (3,4). According to this study, primary coronary artery dissection as a reason for acute myocardial infarction was seen in only three cases among the antepartum group and eight cases in the postpartum group. According to our medical literature review, there are 14 reported cases of coronary artery dissection during the antepartum period, including our case (5–16). Patient characteristics, risk factors, clinical course, treatment modalities and mode of the delivery were determined. The mean age of the cases was 33.1 (range: 22–44), and the mean gravida and parity were 2.0 (range: 1–5) and 0.9 (range: 0–3), respectively. The 24-year-old patient, in our case, was the youngest patient in the literature. The earliest gestational age reported was 9 weeks; the pregnancy resulted in maternal death (11). The mean gestational age was 33 weeks (range: 9–40). In only two cases (14%) did the patients have risk factors for coronary artery disease; one (7%) had hypertension, the other one (7%) was a smoker. LAD was involved in 11 (78%) patients, whereas the left circumflex artery (LCx) was involved in seven (50%) patients. Only LAD involvement, which was determined in 50% of all the patients, was the most common location of dissection. The involvement of more than one vessel was seen in six (42%) patients (Table I). Anterior wall myocardial infarction (AWMI), which occurred in six (42%) patients, was the most common type of myocardial infarction (Table II). Out of all the patients, four (29%) died (6,11,15). Two pregnant women of 40 and 9 weeks gestation died along with their fetuses. Two healthy babies were delivered from another two died women by emergency cesarean sections (6,15). Maternal and fetal mortality were determined as 29% and 7% (excluding the 9 week pregnant patient), respectively. Because of hemodynamic instability, three (21%) patients had emergency coronary artery bypass surgery (grafting) and the remaining patients were treated with medical therapy until their delivery time. The initial treatment of coronary artery dissection should probably consist of heparin, nitro-glycerin and immediate catheterization. Choice of treatment mostly depends on the result of the angiography. According to literature many of the non-pregnant patients suffering from coronary artery dissection were treated with thrombolysis (33% of all cases) (17). Thrombolytic therapy should be performed very carefully as on the one hand the thrombolytic treatment may resolve the thrombus in the false lumen and improve the flow in the true lumen; on the other hand thrombolysis may aggravate the bleeding and the dissection. Although thrombolytic agents have been used in pregnancy for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (18), their usage for coronary artery dissection in pregnancy is not recommended due to the increased risk of maternal and fetal hemorrhage. Among the cases we reviewed, thrombolytic therapy was not used. Therapeutic modalities concerning the non-medical treatment of women with spontaneous coronary artery dissection are not clearly defined. Coronary bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary artery stenting are used for treatment (19,20). Some authors think that PTCA could be applied to dissection, as it has a limited extension of up to 1 cm and causes less than 50% narrowing of the lumen. A coronary artery must be stented after PTCA to prevent extension and recurrence of the dissection. However, some authors believe that coronary bypass surgery with or without a cardiopulmonary bypass is the most preferred surgical treatment of coronary artery dissection even in pregnant women who do not have contraindication for anesthesia and surgery (21). Except for our case, all the patients were delivered by cesarean sections. We do not exactly know the indications for cesarean sections in these patients, but our case was delivered via a normal vaginal delivery. Concerning the type of delivery there is not enough data in the literature. All of the patients, except for ours, had no history of any medication during the time of dissection. In the case we presented, the patient had being using oral ritodrine for preterm labor for 1 week before the onset of dissection. During pregnancy, the increment of heart rate and blood volume makes the heart require more oxygen. Because our case had no risk factors, her use of oral ritodrine seems to have further increased the demand for oxygen of her heart with its positive inotropic effect and predispose the coronary artery dissection. In the literature, there are no primary coronary artery dissection cases associated with ritodrine usage among pregnant and non-pregnant patients. Because acute myocardial infarction is rare among young people, the possibility of intrinsic coronary artery dissection must be considered when a pregnant woman presents with signs of a myocardial infarction.

Stage 3 borderline ovarian lesions should be dealt with by the type of radical surgery reserved for frankly invasive ovarian cancer. The place of chemotherapy where the metastatic disease is histologically borderline in nature is still unclear although many would advocate its use. However when there is no evidence of spread beyond the ovary and the histology confirmed by an expert places the tumour in the borderline malignancy group, then no further therapy is indicated, even when the ovarian tumour is large. Alkylating agents used for chemotherapy have approximately a 10% long-term incidence of leukaemia and subsequent risk of death. There seems to be little point in having a classification of borderline malignancy if the patient is to be subjected to radical treatment in any case, even though the authors make the exception of the premenopausal patient who may wish to conceive. Proper staging at operation is important but it is also essential that the pathologist is an expert. In the Editors' experience there is usually only one or two such senior pathologists in any major city and usually pathologists are wise enough to make sure their local expert reviews the sections of all such cases. In this series a large proportion of the patients received radical surgery and chemotherapy as for ovarian carcinoma; although the results were exemplary, especially if one excludes the patient with the Stage 3 lesion, we consider that the treatment of Stage la ovarian borderline tumours does not require the use of adjuvant chemotherapy.; ; ; ; Summary: : Twenty-four patients with borderline epithelial ovarian tumours treated in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Hacettepe University during the last 12 years were evaluated with regard to histopathology, therapeutic modalities employed and outcome.

Treatment consists of surgery, but even patients with early-stages are at high risk of recurrence. Although the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) is uncertain, and prospective data are very limited, AC use is increasing. <h3>Methodology</h3> Daydream is a multicentre, observational study, in patients with surgically resected FIGO stages I to IV HGUS with or without AC from 2013 to 2018. The primary endpoint is OS. We selected potential prognostic variables based on previous evidence and performed inverse probability weighting to establish two homogeneous groups regarding the use of AC. A risk stratification into 3 groups (high, medium and low) was defined based on baseline variables associated with an increased risk of death in the multivariate analysis (p&lt;0.05). We performed a proportional hazard Cox regression to calculate the HR of death associated to the use of AC in these 3 risk groups. <h3>Results</h3> 746 patients from 47 centers in 22 countries were registered until December 2023. Initially 135 patients were excluded (mostly due to lack of information or inconsistencies). 156 additional patients were excluded due to missing information in the five variables we found associated with OS in the multivariate analysis (p&lt;0.05): FIGO stage, tumor size, post-surgical histology, mitoses per 10 HPF and LSVI. OS differences of the 3 groups is shown in Table 1 Figure A. Median OS in high-risk group in patients with or without AC was 29.93 and 19.15 months respectively (HR 0.48 (0.26-0.88),p=0.02) (Table 1, Figure B). There were no differences in medium and low risk groups (Table 1, Figure C and D). <h3>Conclusion</h3> To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a clear benefit in overall survival for a high-risk group of HGUS patients receiving AC, and suggests the potential development of a risk score to identify patients benefiting from AC. <h3>Disclosures</h3> Attached.",,,A573.1,A573,Adjuvant chemotherapy; Adjuvant; Chemotherapy; Primary treatment; Medicine; Gynecology; Oncology; Internal medicine; Cancer; Breast cancer,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2024-esgo.1117,,10.1136/ijgc-2024-esgo.1117,,,0,,0,false,,

This paper is reviewing the clinicopathologic and prognostic characteristics and therapeutic options for treatment of immature teratoma during pregnancy in the context of a case of pregnancy complicated with immature teratoma. Materials and Methods: A PubMed and Scopus search was conducted with the key words ‘ovarian immature teratoma’ and ‘pregnancy’ and all related published articles assessed. A total of 24 cases, included our case were included in the study. Age at presentation, clinical findings, histologic grades and stages, treatment options and the prognosis of both mothers and fetuses was analysed. Results: The median age of the patients in the published reports was 27.0± 4.2 ( range 21-36) years. The main presenting symptom was adnexal mass followed by abdominal or pelvic pain.

Tests are carried out under different mode mixity ratios to evaluate the applicability of a fracture criterion developed in a previous study to mixed mode-I/II fatigue crack growth tests. Results obtained from the analyses and experiments are compared with existing and developed criteria in terms of crack growth lives. Compact Tension Shear (CTS) specimens, which enable mixed mode loading with loading devices under different loading angles, are used in the simulations and experiments. In an effort to model and simulate the actual conditions in the experiments, crack surfaces of fractured specimens are scanned, crack paths are modeled exactly, and contacts are defined between the contact surfaces of a specimen and the loading device for each crack propagation step in the analyses. Having computed the mixed mode stress intensity factors from the numerical analyses, propagation life cycles are predicted by existing and the developed mixed mode-I/II criteria and then compared with experimental results.",31,7,1525,1534,Mode (statistics); Materials science; Tension (physics); Fracture (geology); Aluminium; Stress intensity factor; Fracture mechanics; Structural engineering; Paris' law; Shear (sheet metal),,,,Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1000936118301699,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cja.2018.05.009,,10.1016/j.cja.2018.05.009,2804655392,,0,000-156-306-176-238; 007-152-143-946-141; 010-036-579-702-463; 011-460-859-659-251; 015-468-349-025-795; 017-684-104-157-393; 024-356-222-089-222; 030-326-839-210-977; 033-432-102-497-318; 035-418-889-086-783; 035-635-472-748-148; 038-247-604-963-304; 047-751-642-769-392; 058-590-433-403-196; 061-204-614-672-010; 064-613-757-296-16X; 065-398-553-036-304; 067-127-219-235-111; 070-558-051-192-236; 072-843-977-455-701; 075-875-862-570-449; 076-729-868-673-933; 089-048-240-923-771; 105-930-835-343-705; 114-298-209-642-724; 119-037-573-391-673; 122-564-609-505-680; 123-179-061-040-691; 140-499-144-907-253; 143-435-162-182-205; 147-444-044-830-355; 148-446-825-721-296; 156-170-516-235-37X; 160-359-080-882-747; 163-469-036-716-350,29,true,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid

Majority of the recurrences (82.1%) were detected within the initial 2 years of the SLL procedure. Multivariate analysis revealed stage and grade of the disease to be the significant predictors for the recurrent disease (P < 0.01 and P = 0.025, respectively). A second analysis with respect to initial metastatic sites revealed omental metastatis was significantly associated with recurrent disease (P < 0.001). Survival of patients with a recurrent disease was significantly poorer and dropped abruptly once a recurrence is developed.; ; ; ; Conclusions; ; Patients with initial omental metastasis, advanced stage and high grade tumors have highest risk for developing recurrences after a (−) SLL.

Adjuvant therapy in stage IB (formerly IC) endometrial cancer is controversial, treatment options including observation or brachytherapy/ radiotherapy in grade 1-3 patients with or without chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes of our patients with stage IB endometrioid endometrial cancer. Materials and Methods: Sixty two patients with stage IB endometrial cancer and endometrioid histology were retrospectively evaluated. All patients were initially treated surgically by the same surgeon with comprehensive staging, i.e. total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salphingooopherectomy, bilateral pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection and omentectomy. Adjuvant radiotherapy was discussed with patients and utilized by those who accepted. Adjuvant chemotherapy was not given to any of the patients. Results: Median age was 62 (range, 42-95). Ninety percent of the patients had grade 1-2 disease. Thirteen patients (21%) received intra vaginal brachytherapy (IVBT) and one received whole pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT). Median follow-up time was 46 months (range, 9-77 months). Three patients experienced recurrence (4.8%), two of them died on follow-up and one was still alive at last visit. Two patients with recurrence had FIGO grade 2 tumors and one had a grade 3 tumor. Two patients (3.2%) died without evidence of recurrent disease.

To report our experience treating adnexal masses using a combination of the SILS port and straight nonroticulating laparoscopic instruments. Study Design. This prospective feasibility study included 14 women with symptomatic and persistent adnexal masses. Removal of adnexal masses via single-incision laparoscopic surgery using a combination of the SILS port and straight nonroticulating laparoscopic instruments was performed. Results. All of the patients had symptomatic complex adnexal masses. Mean age of the patients was 38.4 years (range: 21–61 years) and mean duration of surgery was 71 min (range: 45–130 min). All surgeries were performed using nonroticulating straight laparoscopic instruments. Mean tumor diameter was 6 cm (range: 5–12 cm). All patient pathology reports were benign. None of the patients converted to laparotomy. All the patients were discharged on postoperative d1. Postoperatively, all the patients were satisfied with their incision and cosmetic results. Conclusion. All 14 patients were successfully treated using standard, straight nonroticulating laparoscopic instruments via the SILS port. This procedure can reduce the cost of treatment, which may eventually lead to more widespread use of the SILS port approach. Furthermore, concomitant surgical procedures are possible using this approach.

Methods Patients who underwent at least bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy after SLN mapping were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were categorized into low, intermediate, high-intermediate, and high-risk groups defined by ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO. Results Out of 395 eligible patients, 42 patients had SLN metastasis and 16 (38.1%) of them also had non-SLN metastasis. Size of SLN metastasis was the only factor associated with non-SLN metastasis (p = .012) as 13/22 patients with macrometastasis, 2/10 with micrometastasis and 1/10 with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) had non-SLN metastasis. Although all 4 metastases (1.8%) among the low-risk group were limited to SLNs, the non-SLN involvement rate in the high-risk group was 42.9% and all of these were seen in patients with macrometastatic SLNs. Conclusions Non-SLN metastasis was more frequent in higher-risk groups and the risk of non-SLN metastasis increased with the size of SLN metastasis. Proceeding to complete lymphadenectomy when SLN is metastatic should further be studied as the effect of leaving metastatic non-SLNs in-situ is not known.",123,2,638,645,Internal medicine; Oncology; Endometrial cancer; Micrometastasis; Metastasis; Sentinel lymph node; Gynecologic oncology; Lymphadenectomy; Macrometastasis; Incidence (epidemiology); Medicine,endometrial cancer; lymph node dissection; lymphatic metastasis; sentinel lymph node,"Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell/secondary; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/secondary; Endometrial Neoplasms/pathology; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hysterectomy; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Micrometastasis/diagnosis; Neoplasm Staging; Pelvic Neoplasms/secondary; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sentinel Lymph Node/pathology; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33259650 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33259650/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jso.26310 https://avesis.istanbul.edu.tr/yayin/6e5a272a-b106-4663-96b4-b18a293ef719/can-risk-groups-accurately-predict-non-sentinel-lymph-node-metastasis-in-sentinel-lymph-node-positive-endometrial-cancer-patients-a-turkish-gynecologic-oncology-group-study-trsgo-sln-004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jso.26310,33259650,10.1002/jso.26310,3109760327,,0,002-369-897-938-928; 004-003-053-687-408; 005-610-863-271-704; 006-527-104-576-602; 008-365-966-586-285; 011-849-883-477-090; 014-807-163-327-266; 017-685-957-553-237; 020-742-166-984-723; 023-073-703-548-526; 029-869-230-395-583; 030-563-841-338-397; 030-867-480-828-894; 031-844-827-366-76X; 032-811-640-132-053; 037-607-187-324-690; 037-735-042-378-002; 042-555-494-783-538; 045-149-789-046-709; 046-959-715-391-789; 055-397-502-134-089; 062-590-361-803-821; 066-263-601-041-174; 067-288-880-161-781; 068-396-427-340-84X; 073-406-144-463-433; 077-252-623-743-21X; 093-660-706-532-373; 093-713-882-451-843,5,false,,

Methods The database of the Turkish Ministry of Health was searched in order to identify all consecutive gynecologic cancer patients undergoing major surgery between March 11, 2020 and April 30, 2020 for this retrospective, nationwide, cohort study. The inclusion criteria were strictly founded on a final histopathological diagnosis of a malignant gynecologic tumor. COVID-19 cases were diagnosed by reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2. The rate of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and the 30-day mortality rate of COVID-19 patients were investigated. Results During the study period, 688 women with gynecologic cancer undergoing major surgery were identified nationwide. The median age of the patients was 59 years. Most of the surgeries were open (634/688, 92.2%). There were 410 (59.6%) women with endometrial cancer, 195 (28.3%) with ovarian cancer, 66 (9.6%) with cervical cancer, 14 (2.0%) with vulvar cancer and 3 (0.4%) with uterine sarcoma. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery was 46/688 (6.7%). All but one woman was diagnosed postoperatively (45/46, 97.8%). The rates of intensive care unit admission and invasive mechanical ventilation were 4/46 (8.7%) and 2/46 (4.3%), respectively. The 30-day mortality rate was 0%. Conclusion In the COVID-19 era, gynecologic cancer surgery may be performed with an acceptable rate of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection if the staff and the patients strictly adhere to the established infection control measures.",160,2,499,505,Surgery; Mortality rate; Cohort study; Intensive care unit; Endometrial cancer; Cervical cancer; Vulvar cancer; Ovarian cancer; Perioperative; Medicine,Coronavirus infection; Gynecologic neoplasms; Period; Perioperative; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Surgery,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19/epidemiology; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female/surgery; Humans; Middle Aged; Perioperative Period; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Turkey/epidemiology; Young Adult",,,https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/pt/covidwho-926965 https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=202102223922109605 https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090825820341251/pdf https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258(20)34125-1/fulltext https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090825820341251 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33223221/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223221 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.11.014 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7670981,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.11.014,33223221,10.1016/j.ygyno.2020.11.014,3104176640,PMC7670981,0,000-879-399-750-663; 003-411-058-039-975; 004-766-459-567-110; 009-724-901-021-505; 010-319-095-184-209; 013-767-109-587-462; 018-748-676-770-050; 019-168-055-398-271; 021-476-974-960-137; 024-119-535-892-578; 028-405-754-897-785; 028-787-234-320-372; 035-407-386-125-732; 036-135-447-099-831; 044-277-668-258-449; 045-179-890-315-237; 045-963-288-601-491; 047-094-185-103-44X; 049-210-365-290-957; 049-750-014-806-701; 055-889-496-921-393; 065-607-147-626-008; 073-126-986-189-657; 081-118-560-654-582; 081-455-723-125-35X; 083-428-022-472-470; 130-557-115-034-027,7,true,,green

Methodology We performed aretrospective, multicenter study by participation of five gynecologic cancer centers. At first, stage IIIC ovarian HGSC patients were classified asoptimally or maximally debulked cohorts. Then in each cohort, patients were divided into two groups: The IP(+)/RP(–) group included women with transcoelomic spread outside the pelvis with no nodal disease, The IP(+)/RP(+) group included patients with transcoelomic dissemination outside the pelvis in addition to positive nodal status. Survival outcomes were compared between the two groups in each cohort. Results A total of 405 ovarian HGSC patients were analyzed. In the optimally debulked cohort (n=257), the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the IP(+)/RP(-) group (n=69) was 24 and 57 months, respectively compared to 21 and 58 months in the IP(+)/RP(+) group (n=188) (p=0.78, and p=0.40; respectively). In the maximally debulked cohort (n=148), the median PFS and OS for the IP(+)/RP(-) group (n=55) was 35 and 63 months, respectively compared to 25 and 51 months in the IP(+)/RP(+) group (n=93) (p=0.49, and p=0.31; respectively). Conclusion Our findings indicated no survival difference between the IP(+)/RP(-) and the IP(+)/RP(+) groups after maximal or optimal cytoreduction.

Nonetheless, modern RT techniques may be useful in certain patients particularly those with recurrent disease.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""PRESENTATION OF CASE"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">After surgery and chemotherapy, two patients, aged 57 and 70, presented with recurrent lesions in the parailiac region. The recurrent lesions were treated with high field 1.5-Tesla MR-Linac treatment in 5 fractions at a dose of 30 Gy. The patients tolerated the treatment well and were disease free after 12 and 20 months of magnetic resonance guided radiotherapy (MRgRT), respectively.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">MRgRT is a novel and rapidly evolving technology that allows for the highly precise treatment of even mobile targets through direct visualization of the tumor. The majority of patients with EOC frequently present with abdominal-pelvic recurrences. It has been demonstrated that EOC requires high radiation doses for curative treatment. MR-Linac enables monitoring of organ motion during treatment, which is necessary for delivering higher doses to target volumes while sparing surrounding organs.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">To reduce radiation doses to nearby normal tissues, MRgRT allows for the delivery of hypofractionated RT with tight safety margins. Regardless of initial resistance or gradual development of intolerance to standard chemotherapy regimens, the role of RT in patients with persistent or recurrent EOC should be reconsidered.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: Records of 26 patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 with uterine carcinosarcoma were retrospectively evaluated for demographic features, tumor characteristics, treatment regimens and patient outcomes in terms of DFS and OS Results: Median age was 61 (range 43-78). 10 patients (38%) had stage I disease at diagnosis, 3 (12%) had stage II, 4 (15%) had stage III and 9 (35%) had stage IV. Sixteen patients (62%) received chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin for 6 cycles. One patient underwent radiotherapy. Median follow up was 17 months. Sixteen patients relapsed and 13 died during follow up. Considering recurrence, 5 out of 16 patients had lung metastases, one had brain metastases and 9 had only intraabdominal recurrence. The 3 year DFS was 37% and the 3 year OS was 30%. Conclusions: Our data show that uterine carcinosarcomas tend to be at advanced stage at diagnosis and despite the use of chemotherapy, overall prognosis is poor.

Materials and methods The retrospective cohort study included patients who had applied to Baskent University's Ankara Hospital between January 2007 and October 2018 with either AH/EIN (n: 27; Group A) or EEC (n: 30; Group B), and who had the desire to preserve their fertility. The medical records of all patients included in the study were reviewed retrospectively from the hospital records. Results There were 2 (7.4%) and 5 (16.7%) recurrences, whereby one patient from Group A and two patients from Group B underwent staging surgery. In Group A, 8 patients attempted pregnancy after their treatment and 4 of them (50%) became pregnant, while 3 of them (37.5%) had a live birth. In Group B, there were 17 patients who wanted to become pregnant following treatment of the disease; 8 of them (47%) became pregnant after treatment, 5 of them (16.6%) had a live birth, 1 experienced intrauterine exitus (at 21st gestational week, 350 g), and 2 currently have ongoing pregnancies.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could improve the accuracy rates of MR imaging. The aim of this study was to assess the additional diagnostic value of DWI over conventional MR imaging in assessing the local extent of primary cervical cancer. Method: Forty patients with primary uterine cervical cancer were enrolled in the study, prospectively. All MR examinations were performed using a 1.5 Tesla Unit MR with a body coil. Sagittal and axial T2-weighted MR images, sagittal and axial DWI (at b values of 0, 500,1000 s/mm 2 ) with ADC maps were obtained. The images were evaluated by two different readers independently. The degree of the interobserver agreement between the radiologists was assessed with kappa statistics. Results: Mean age of the study population was 50.7±11.1 years. Kappa values ranged from 0.76 to 1 for both readers indicating excellent agreement. Accuracy rates were as follows for reader 1 respectively with conventional and conventional plus DWI; stromal invasion 0.92/0.95; parametrial invasion 0.87/0.92; vaginal invasion 0.87/0.92; pelvic sidewall invasion 0.90/0.97.

The incidence of cervical cancer and the 3-year overall survival of the patients were investigated. <h3>Results</h3> Results: With an age-standardized incidence of 4.2/100.000, cervical cancer is the 10th most common cancer among women in Turkey. During the study period, 658.000 women were screened for cervical cancer and 2539 new cervical cases were detected nationwide. The median age of the patients was 53 (range, 20–94) years. Cervical biopsy revealed HSIL in 195 (7.7%) women before the final diagnosis and 1671 (65.8%) cases were associated with HPV 16/18. The histologic distribution of the cases were as follows: squamous cell carcinoma in 1972 (77.7%), adenocarcinoma in 380 (15.0%) and adenosquamous cell carcinoma in 54 (2.1%) women. Primary chemoradiation was applied as primary treatment in 1285 (50.6%) women whereas 1254 (49.4%) underwent surgery. There were 938 (74.8%) radical and 249 (19.8%) simple hysterectomies. With a median follow-up of 28 months, the 3-year overall survival rates were 92.7%, 89.8% and 83.6% for stage IB1, IB2 and IB3, respectively. The 3-year overall survival rate for stage IIB was 79.1%. According to histologic subtypes, the 3-year overall survival rates were 71.9%, 72.0%, and 70.9% for women with squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous cell carcinoma, respectively. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Conclusion: In spite of a 10-years' experience of a nation-based cervical cancer screening program, cervical cancer still seems to represent an important tumor burden in Turkey. <h3>Disclosures</h3> NONE",,,A80.2,A81,Cervical cancer; Cervical cancer screening; Medicine; Cancer; Computer science; Internal medicine,,,,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/33/Suppl_3/A80.2.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.160,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.160,,10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.160,,,0,,0,true,other-oa,hybrid

ASCUS (atypical cells of undetermined significance) observed in about 4-5% of all cervical cytology specimens. We searched for the presence of HPV with immunohistochemical methods in the biopsy material of patients diagnosed with ASCUS using cytology. Material and method The colposcopic biopsy or Loop Electro Excisional Procedure (LEEP) material of 115 patients with a diagnosis of ASCUS were evaluated. HPV (type 6,11,16,18,31,33,42,51,52,56 and 58) immunohistochemistry was applied to all materials. The relationship between the biopsy results and HPV positivity was investigated. Results Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I was found in 34.8%, CIN II in 13% and CIN III in 9.6% of the patients and cervicitis was present in 42.6% of the patients. HPV immunohistochemistry was positive in 11 cases (9.6%) and no staining was seen in 104 cases (90.4%). No positive staining was seen in the chronic cervicitis cases. The rate of positive staining was 15% (6/34) in the CIN I diagnosed group, 20% (3/12) in the CIN II diagnosed group and 18.2% (2/9) in the CIN III diagnosed group. Conclusion HPV positivity was found to be lower compared to the literature both in total and in cases diagnosed by biopsy. No staining occurred in any patient with cervicitis.

Methods A dual-institutional, database review was carried out to screen patients with STUMP who were treated with upfront surgery between January 2006 and December 2017. Data including age at the time of diagnosis, recurrence rate, disease-free survival, overall survival, and fertility outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Results Fifty-seven patients with STUMPs were included in the study. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 42 (range, 16 to 75) years. The median follow-up was 57 (range, 16 to 125) months. Eight patients (14%) had recurrence during follow-up. Recurrent STUMPs were seen in seven patients and leiomyosarcoma after 14 months in one patient. Seven patients with a recurrent STUMP survived, while the remaining patient died. Recurrence rates were similar for women who underwent myomectomy and those who underwent hysterectomy. The presence of uterine localization of tumor (subserosal vs intramural-submucosal) statistically significantly affected recurrence rates (odds ratio=5.72; 95% confidence interval=1.349-24.290; p=0.018). Ten of 27 patients who underwent myomectomy for uterine myoma had fertility desire. Seven pregnancies were recorded. Conclusions Our study results suggest that fertility-sparing approaches are feasible in patients with STUMP, although recurrence may be seen.",30,4,e54,,Surgery; Odds ratio; Leiomyosarcoma; Hysterectomy; Smooth Muscle Tumor; Overall survival; Clinicopathological features; Confidence interval; Fertility; Medicine,Hysterectomy; Myomectomy; Recurrence; Smooth muscle tumors  uterine,"Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Fertility Preservation/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Hysterectomy/statistics & numerical data; Leiomyosarcoma/pathology; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Single-Blind Method; Smooth Muscle Tumor/pathology; Uterine Myomectomy/statistics & numerical data; Uterine Neoplasms/pathology; Young Adult",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31074239/ https://www.ejgo.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2019.30.e54 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074239 https://pc.ejgo.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2019.30.e54 https://ejgo.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/1114JGO/jgo-30-e54.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31074239 https://synapse.koreamed.org/articles/1125143 https://pc.ejgo.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/1114JGO/jgo-30-e54.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6543118 https://synapse.koreamed.org/upload/SynapseData/PDFData/1114jgo/jgo-30-e54.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2019.30.e54,31074239,10.3802/jgo.2019.30.e54,2914458254,PMC6543118,0,001-837-669-448-976; 002-067-186-532-59X; 002-138-672-055-27X; 003-002-047-012-876; 006-473-269-945-524; 006-601-842-554-846; 006-915-603-952-267; 007-098-268-237-344; 009-896-921-006-178; 011-184-407-390-177; 012-844-061-150-770; 020-818-979-557-591; 025-879-289-777-424; 031-363-001-234-499; 034-225-062-741-842; 034-415-561-844-624; 035-868-910-687-822; 042-297-419-536-554; 043-438-820-288-174; 047-515-217-148-240; 056-087-190-760-998; 069-428-361-939-410; 074-821-956-400-352; 079-137-806-864-857; 098-464-020-621-527; 100-570-246-432-365; 101-011-813-619-755; 111-502-602-988-349; 129-689-214-937-511; 145-607-173-489-043,26,true,cc-by-nc,gold

CD47 is an antiphagocytic molecule aiding tumor resistance against host immune surveillance. The relationship between CD47 expression and TAM-related microenvironment in endometrial carcinoma (EC) is poorly understood. The expression and prognostic significance of CD47 and CD163-labeled TAMs in 165 EC cases was assessed with CD47 and CD163 immunohistochemical studies. CD47 expression was found in 156/165 (94.6%) cases. CD47 expression was significantly higher in nonendometrioid carcinomas. CD47 overexpression was associated with histologic grade. High epithelial and stromal TAMs counts were also associated with high tumoral CD47 expression. High epithelial, stromal, and margin TAMs counts were associated with higher histologic grade and lymphovascular invasion. Epithelial TAMs counts were higher in patients with nonendometrioid carcinomas (P=0.0001) and cases with recurrence (P=0.018). High stromal TAMs counts were associated with deeper myometrial invasion (P=0.017) and the presence of distant metastasis (P=0.024). The counts of margin TAMs was significantly correlated with the depth of myometrial invasion, lymphovascular invasion, FIGO stage, lymph node metastases, distant metastasis, and recurrence (P=0.0001, 0.0001, 0.004, 0.005, 0.014, and 0.04, respectively). CD47 expression was not associated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival. However, high epithelial and stromal TAM counts were associated with shorter OS. Besides, high epithelial and margin TAM counts were associated with shorter progression-free survival. Furthermore, increased stromal and margin TAM counts were determined to be an independent prognostic marker of reduced OS. TAM count is, therefore, a significant prognostic factor in EC and the CD47 assessment has potential benefit for future clinical use.",41,4,397,406,Cancer; Pathology; Stromal cell; Stage (cooking); Immunohistochemistry; CD163; Carcinoma; Lymphovascular invasion; Lymph node; Medicine,,"Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism; CD47 Antigen/metabolism; Carcinoma/pathology; Endometrial Neoplasms/diagnosis; Female; Humans; Macrophages/metabolism; Prognosis; Tumor Microenvironment; Tumor-Associated Macrophages","Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic; CD47 Antigen; CD47 protein, human",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34282107/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/pgp.0000000000000809,34282107,10.1097/pgp.0000000000000809,3185184029,,0,003-206-460-816-952; 006-963-267-433-551; 008-195-010-031-796; 010-324-944-665-602; 012-074-049-724-657; 014-735-096-408-559; 019-399-247-815-381; 034-501-530-330-859; 034-958-450-561-702; 036-259-520-011-117; 042-677-171-409-31X; 046-897-454-570-728; 051-031-183-367-448; 053-060-893-131-961; 065-120-242-142-752; 068-939-318-426-052; 070-200-711-746-219; 076-573-116-791-373; 077-103-792-840-601; 085-834-011-038-608; 094-622-235-126-086; 098-501-425-333-099; 114-682-275-053-190; 120-914-445-413-943; 135-674-631-523-323,5,false,,

Patients with FIGO-2009-stage IB1-IIA1 cervical cancer who underwent RH, did not undergo neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and with pathologic negative lymph nodes, were included. Patients were treated in national referral centers for gynecologic oncology according to updated national/international guidelines. Optimal cut-offs for surgical volume were identified using an unadjusted Cox proportional hazard model with DFS as outcome and defined as the value which minimizes the p-value of the split in groups in terms of DFS. A Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was used to adjust the differences between the groups baseline characteristics. <h3>Results</h3> 2,157 patients were initially included. The two most significant cut-offs for surgical volume were identified in 7 and 17 surgical procedures, dividing the entire cohort in low, middle, and high-volume centers. After PSM, 1,238 patients, distributed as 619 (50.0%) in high-volume, 523 (42.2%) in middle-volume and 96 (7.8%) in low-volume group, were analyzed. Patients operated in higher volume institutions had a progressively better 5-year DFS than those operated in lower volume centers (92.3% vs 88.9% vs 83.8%,p=0.029). No 5-year OS difference was noted (95.9% vs 97.2% vs 95.2%,p=0.70). Cox multivariate regression analysis for risk of showed that FIGO-stage &gt;IB1, LVSI+, grade &gt;1, tumor diameter &gt;20 mm, minimally invasive approach, non-squamous cell histology, and lower volume centers represented independent risk factors for recurrence. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Surgical volume represented an independent prognostic factor affecting DFS. Increasing number of RHs performed in each center every year was associated with improved DFS. Performance of at least 18 RHs per year may be considered the target volume of cases for referral centers associated with better DFS.",,,A52.2,A53,Medicine; Cervical cancer; Radical Hysterectomy; Retrospective cohort study; Propensity score matching; Stage (stratigraphy); Hazard ratio; Internal medicine; Proportional hazards model; Oncology; Surgery; Cancer; Urology; Confidence interval; Paleontology; Biology,,,,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/32/Suppl_2/A52.2.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2022-esgo.114,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2022-esgo.114,,10.1136/ijgc-2022-esgo.114,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

The steps of crack growth analysis by using Fracture and Crack Propagation Analysis System (FCPAS) are detailed. As a result of crack growth analyses, stress intensity factor (SIF) distributions, growing crack fronts and crack growth lives are plotted and compared with the results of another study in the literature. The obtained results are in agreement with the literature data. Variation crack growth material properties and its effect on fatigue crack growth life is investigated.

Likewise, the type 2 radical hysterectomy (mobilization of ureters without wide lateral excision of transverse cervical ligaments) is not advocated in this country for clinical Stage I carcinoma of the endometrium. Accordingly readers will be interested to read that lymph node metastases were found in the pelvic nodes from 16 patients (15.1 %) and in the paraaortic nodes from 9 (8.5%) in this series. The authors also provide information showing the correlations between the incidences of nodal metastases and grade and site of the tumour, presence of myometrial invasion, adnexal involvement and histology of the tumour. This paper is not concerned with details of treatment after initial surgery (irradiation to the vaginal vault and/or pelvis, progestogen therapy). The oncologist who reviewed this paper made the point that it is neither easy nor reasonable to perform pelvic and paraaortic node clearances in all patients with Stage 1 carcinoma of the endometrium, many of whom are elderly and/or obese. Although the FIGO recommendation is to use surgical staging for presentation of results of treatment of carcinoma of the endometrium, this cannot be applied until after surgery has been performed, since depth of invasion of the tumour and presence of vascular involvement cannot be judged by examination of the curettings. The authors' statement that pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy has major therapeutic importance in patients with clinical Stage 1 endometrial carcinoma of course cannot be judged from the data in this report. Readers may decide that the information in this paper justifies consideration of lymphadenectomy in some patients with clinical Stage 1 carcinoma of the endometrium. It seems fair to state that the authors' phrase ‘primary surgical staging’ is really synonymous with radical surgical management for all patients with clinical Stage 1 carcinoma of the endometrium.; ; ; ; Summary: The incidences of pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastases in 106 patients with clinical Stage 1 endometrium cancer are presented. AH patients were primarily surgically staged and treatment consisted of peritoneal cytology assessment, type II radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingooophorectomy, pelvic and paraaortic total lymphadenectomy. Pelvic lymph node metastases were present in 15.1% and paraaortic lymph node metastases in 8.5% of the patients. Multiple prognostic factors were evaluated in respect to nodal status. This study adds credence to primary surgical staging with total pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy regardless of presence or absence of the various risk factors.",29,3,332,335,Surgery; Stage (cooking); Carcinoma; Pelvis; Vaginal vault; Lymphadenectomy; Lymph node; Paraaortic lymph nodes; Radical Hysterectomy; Medicine,,Female; Humans; Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology; Retrospective Studies; Turkey; Uterine Neoplasms/complications,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2619683 https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1479-828X.1989.tb01757.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-828x.1989.tb01757.x,2619683,10.1111/j.1479-828x.1989.tb01757.x,2044744112,,0,018-551-639-514-382; 026-456-155-336-692; 035-573-454-678-042; 038-237-749-322-058; 044-292-739-159-92X; 047-557-096-882-566; 048-318-473-670-293; 081-811-925-057-330,9,false,,

In addition, radical hysterectomy (RH) competed with radical vaginal hysterectomy during the early history of RH. The primitive form of RH was first described by Clark and Reis in 1895. Radical hysterectomy was then described in detail and performed by Wertheim, more than 100 years ago. Afterward, RH was abandoned for the treatment of carcinomas because of the use of radiotherapy; however, RH was then modified and repopularized by Meigs in the 1950s. The surgical principles of this operation have undergone only minor modifications throughout the years and remained the basis of the surgical approach used by gynecologic oncologists today. The history of the treatment of cervical carcinoma and the history of RH are unique in medicine. Because of the efforts of the surgeons and scientists, cervical carcinoma has become rarer, and its mortality rate has decreased, although it is still common in undeveloped countries. The history of the treatment of cervical carcinoma includes 3 Nobel Prize winners and 1 Nobel Prize nominee. We therefore think that knowledge of the historical development of this filed will inspire and contribute to the education of future generations. In this article, the historical development of the surgical treatment of cervical carcinoma, the contributors to this surgical procedure, and the pioneers of the surgical and medical treatment of cervical carcinoma are summarized; pictures and illustrations are also provided.

A multicenter, retrospective department database review was performed to identify patients with stage III non-serous EOC at 7 gynecologic oncology centers in Turkey. Demographic, clinicopathological and survival data were collected. The patients were divided into three groups based on the initial sites of disease: 1) the retroperitoneal (RP) group included patients who had positive pelvic and /or para-aortic LNs only. 2) The intraperitoneal (IP) group included patients with > 2 cm IP dissemination outside of the pelvis. These patients all had a negative LN status, 3) The IP / RP group included patients with > 2 cm IP dissemination outside of the pelvis as well as positive LN status. Survival data were compared with regard to the groups. We identified 179 women with stage III non-serous EOC who were treated at 7 participating centers during the study period. The median age of the patients was 53 years, and the median duration of follow-up was 39 months. There were 35 (19.6%) patients in the RP group, 72 (40.2%) in the IP group and 72 (40.2%) in the IP/RP group. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates for the RP, the IP, and IP/RP groups were 66.4%, 37.6%, and 25.5%, respectively (p = 0.002). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for the RP group was significantly longer when compared to those of the IP, and the IP/RP groups (74.4% vs. 54%, and 36%, respectively; p = 0.011). However, we were not able to define “RP only disease” as an independent prognostic factor for increased DFS or OS. Primary non-serous EOC patients with node-positive-only disease seem to have better survival when compared to those with extra-pelvic peritoneal involvement.",11,1,21,21,Survival analysis; Internal medicine; Serous fluid; Retrospective cohort study; Stage (cooking); Young adult; Clear-cell adenocarcinoma; Gynecologic oncology; Retroperitoneal Lymph Node; Medicine; Gastroenterology,Clear cell adenocarcinoma; Endometrioid adenocarcinoma; Epithelial ovarian cancer; Lymph node dissection; Mucinous adenocarcinoma; Survival analysis,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/mortality; Ovarian Neoplasms/mortality; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis; Young Adult",,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs13048-018-0393-0 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29506569 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29506569/ https://ovarianresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13048-018-0393-0 https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-018-0393-0 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13048-018-0393-0.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29506569,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13048-018-0393-0,29506569,10.1186/s13048-018-0393-0,2795425890,PMC5838854,0,006-813-025-185-547; 012-250-820-815-748; 013-975-919-239-191; 020-596-663-635-329; 022-634-042-982-149; 026-168-658-551-902; 029-055-183-374-161; 032-608-732-622-371; 035-735-883-554-688; 040-798-559-579-014; 042-388-703-432-14X; 050-802-064-002-223; 051-840-304-858-973; 053-456-184-977-156; 058-376-192-591-677; 069-579-655-699-254; 087-289-465-015-98X; 127-581-534-694-873; 151-341-516-910-12X,2,true,"CC BY, CC0",gold

Understanding the risk factors that contribute to sentinel lymph node(SLN) metastasis is of paramount importance. This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the risk factors associated with SLN metastasis. <h3>Methodology</h3> A total of 874 women with EC were included in this retrospective study. Out of the initial cohort of 874 patients, a total of 793 patients with successful SLN mapping were included and analysed to investigate the risk factors for SLN metastasis in EC. <h3>Results</h3> SLN metastasis was detected in 73 (9.2%) patients. Among the metastatic cases, 20 (27.4%) patients had isolated tumour cells (ITC), 17 (23.3%) patients had micrometastasis, and 36 (49.3%) patients had macrometastasis in the sentinel lymph nodes. The results of the univariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between SLN metastasis and several factors, including age over 60 years, histology other than endometrioid, tumor grade 3, deep myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), primary tumour diameter of 2 cm or larger, and cervical stromal invasion (p &lt; 0.05). At the end of multivariate analysis, deep myometrial invasion [odds ratio (OR), 2.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29–4.56; p = 0.006], LVSI (OR, 7.27; 95% CI, 3.82–13.81; p &lt; 0.001) and cervical stromal invasion (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.13–4.21; p = 0.020) remained as independent risk factors for SLN involvement in women with EC. <h3>Conclusion</h3> LVSI, deep myometrial invasion, and cervical stromal invasion emerged as independent risk factors for SLN metastasis in patients diagnosed with EC. In cases where the identified risk factors are absent, the omission of lymphadenectomy may be considered in instances of SLN mapping failure. <h3>Disclosures</h3> The authors has no competing financial interests or conflicts of interest to disclose.",,,A132.1,A132,Medicine; Endometrial cancer; Micrometastasis; Sentinel lymph node; Oncology; Internal medicine; Metastasis; Univariate analysis; Odds ratio; Retrospective cohort study; Breast cancer; Cancer; Multivariate analysis,,,,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/33/Suppl_3/A132.1.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.273,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.273,,10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.273,,,0,,0,true,other-oa,hybrid

Method: Female patients(n=306, mean age= 55.2 ± 12.5y) who underwent cytoreduction surgery for gynecological malignancies between February2009-February 2014 in Baskent University recruited into the study.Patient demographic and clinical features were all recorded. The relationship between POPCs and risk factors were evaluated. Results: The incidence of early POPCs was 13%. Thirteen(4.2%) of POPCs were detected on the first day after surgery. POPCs were 3(1%)pneumonia, 8(2.6%)respiratory failure, 21(6.8%) pleural effusion and 6(2%) pulmonary embolism.One of the patients had massive pulmonary embolism resulted in death. Seven(2.3 %) patients had late POPCs between 7th and 30th day after the surgery, while 8(2.6%) of them had after the first month of surgery. The most seen POPC was pleural effusion(n=9 and 2.9 %) in our patients. POPCs were correlated with smoking history(p =0.02) as well as related with the mortality(p = 0.002). Conclusion: Gynological cytoreduction surgery has a higher risk for POPCs despite the surgical location distance.Clinicians should be aware of POPCs to reduce mortality in postoperative period. We conclude that preoperative smoking cessation strategies, early mobilization and respiratory physiotherapy could be important factors to avoid POPCs.",48,,PA3728,,Surgery; Pulmonary embolism; Respiratory failure; Smoking cessation; Pneumonia; Pleural effusion; Respiratory physiotherapy; Clinical course; Incidence (epidemiology); Medicine,,,,,https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/48/suppl_60/PA3728,http://dx.doi.org/10.1183/13993003.congress-2016.pa3728,,10.1183/13993003.congress-2016.pa3728,2552462936,,0,,0,false,,

Some clinical, pathological and surgical data were evaluated. The clinicopathological, surgical data and recurrence and survival rates were evaluated using logistic regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier method. <h3>Results</h3> The median age at diagnosis 42 years (range 13–94) and 65.1% of patients were premenopausal. Majority of cases were Stage I (77.5%) and unilateral (80.6%). The most common histologic types were serous and mucinous. Stromal microinvasion and micropapillary pattern were seen in 15,5% and 22.8%, respectively. 16.8% of patients operated via laparoscopy and 47.6% of cases were undergone conservative surgery (unilateral oopherectomy or cystectomy). Lymphadenectomy, omentectomy (or biopsy), appendectomy and peritoneal biopsies were done in 35.2%, 58.5%, 35.5% and 26.9% of cases, respectively. The median follow-up time was 66.5 months (range 6 – 238 months). Overall, 62 patients (6.1%) experienced recurrence and 14 (1.3%) died within the observation period. Five-year survival rate was 100% and median survival time was 234 months. Univariate analysis showed young age (&lt;40 years), laparoscopic surgery and cystectomy were associated in disease free survival (DFS), lymphadenectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, micropapillary patern and stromal microinvasion were not. None factors revealed no statistically significant association in DFS in multivariate analysis. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Although there is no standart a surgical approach in therapy of BOTs, prognosis is perfect.

The aim of this study was to determine the association of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT) and metformin use with survival in patients with EC.Material and Methods: Clinical and tumor characteristics of 410 patients who underwent surgery for EC in our institution between 2006 and 2012 were reviewed. Demographic features, histological subtypes, stage, type of surgery, comorbidities, treatment modalities and patient outcomes in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed.Results: Median follow-up was 39 months. The presence of HT and DM were associated with overall survival after adjusted for age, disease stage and grade (HR for HT 2.88, p=0.055, HR for DM 2.01, p=0.045). Presence of either HT or DM (or both) was independently associated with lower rate of 5 years survival (HR 8.24, p=0.041). Metformin use was not associated with RFS or OS in whole patient population. However, among patients with diabetes, metformin use was associated with improved 5 years survival (p=0.024) but not with RFS (p=0.47).Conclusion: Our study showed DM and HT to be associated with increased mortality in patients with EC but no link was shown between presence of DM/HT and disease recurrence. Metformin might be the treatment of choice in patients with DM and EC, but beneficial effects are probably through metabolic effects rather than anticancer efficacy.",27,3,907,912,Internal medicine; Oncology; Stage (cooking); Endometrial cancer; Disease; Metformin; In patient; Overall survival; Elderly population; Diabetes mellitus; Medicine,,,,,https://annalsmedres.org/index.php/aomr/article/view/653 https://app.trdizin.gov.tr/makale/TXpZNE5EQTJOZz09/impact-of-comorbidities-on-recurrence-rates-and-survival-in-patients-with-endometrial-cancer,http://dx.doi.org/10.5455/annalsmedres.2019.11.758,,10.5455/annalsmedres.2019.11.758,3011419316,,0,,0,false,,

Following reconstruction of 3D modelling of maxilla, Osteotomes' tip was angulated 45 and 90 to sagittal plane to simulate pterygomaxillary osteotomy. Finite element analyses (FEA) was performed and Von Misses stress distributions were analyzed for two different angulations. Independent sample t test was used to compare differences between 45 and 90 angulations. Von Misses stress values on lateral pterygoid plate were higher in 45 angulation (0.71 ± 0.21 MPa) than 90 angulation (0.54 ± 0.28 MPa). This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Placement of osteotome's tip with 90 angulation had higher stress value than 45 angulation on maxillary tuberosity region. However; difference wasn't significant (P = 0.44). Stress values on body of sphenoid bone were 0.45 ± 0.17MPa for the case of 90 angulation and 0.19 ± 0.09MPa for 45 angulation. Difference between these values were statistically significant (P < 0.01). Possible risk of unfavourable lateral pterygoid plate fracture and complications related with body of sphenoid bone during pterygomaxillary osteotomy was remarkably increased in case of narrow angulation (45).

Descriptive statistics and survival analyses were performed. Patients were stratified according to pathologic tumor diameter. Propensity score match analysis was performed to balance baseline characteristics in patients undergoing nerve-sparing and non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 1257 patients were included. Of note, 883 patients (70.2%) underwent nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy, and 374 patients (29.8%) underwent non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy. Baseline differences between the study groups were found for tumor stage and diameter (higher use of non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy for tumors &gt;2 cm or with vaginal involvement; P&lt;.0001). The use of adjuvant therapy in patients undergoing nerve-sparing and non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy was 27.3% vs 28.6%, respectively (P=.63). Five-year disease-free survival in patients undergoing nerve-sparing vs non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy was 90.1% (95% confidence interval, 87.9-92.2) vs 93.8% (95% confidence interval, 91.1-96.5), respectively (P=.047). Non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy was independently associated with better disease-free survival at multivariable analysis performed on the entire cohort (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.81; P=.004). Furthermore, 5-year overall survival in patients undergoing nerve-sparing vs non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy was 95.7% (95% confidence interval, 94.1-97.2) vs non-nerve-sparing 96.5% (95% confidence interval, 94.3-98.7), respectively (P=.78). In patients with a tumor diameter ≤20 mm, 5-year disease-free survival was 94.7% in nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy vs 96.2% in non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (P=.22). In patients with tumors between 21 and 40 mm, 5-year disease-free survival was 90.3% in non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy vs 83.1% in nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (P=.016) (no significant difference in the rate of adjuvant treatment in this subgroup, P=.47).

Methods We performed a retrospective, multicenter study with the participation of five gynecological cancer centers. First, the stage IIIC ovarian HGSC patients were classified into optimally or maximally debulked cohorts. Then, in each cohort, the patients were divided into two groups; the IP+/RP- group included those women with transcoelomic spreading outside the pelvis with no nodal disease, and the IP+/RP+ group included those patients with transcoelomic dissemination outside the pelvis in addition to a positive nodal status. The survival outcomes were compared between the two groups in each cohort. Results A total of 405 ovarian HGSC patients were analyzed. In the optimally debulked cohort (n = 257), the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) medians for the IP+/RP- group (n = 69) were 24 and 57 months, respectively, compared to 21 and 58 months, respectively, for the IP+/RP+ group (n = 188) (P = 0.78 and P = 0.40, respectively). In the maximally debulked cohort (n = 148), the PFS and OS medians for the IP+/RP- group (n = 55) were 35 and 63 months, respectively, compared to 25 and 51 months, respectively, for the IP+/RP+ group (n = 93) (P = 0.49 and P = 0.31, respectively).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the fetomaternal morbidity and mortality of the pregnancies of women who conceived after cardiac valve replacement. Methods. A consecutive series of one hundred and thirty-six pregnancies of one hundred and one patients who conceived after cardiac valve replacement were retrospectively analyzed. Regarding the anticoagulation therapy, 101 patients were classified into three groups: A: patients on oral anticoagulants (n=68), B: patients on heparin (n=16) and C: patients who received no anticoagulation (n=17). Results. Three groups (patients on oral anticoagulants (A), on heparin (B), patients who received no anticoagulation (C)) were compared in terms of spontaneous abortion (19%, 11%, 5.6%), preterm delivery (14%, 22.3%, 16.6%), maternal mortality (3%, 11.1%, 0%), thromboembolic events (4%, 11.1%, 0%), cardiac failure (6%, 11.1%, 11.1%), atrial fibrillation (9%, 11.1%, 5.6%), antenatal bleeding (9%, 11.1%, 5.6%), delivery route and fetal malformation (5%, 0%, 0%) and no statistically significant differences were detected. In group B, hematoma formation rate (22.2%) (p=0.011) and transfusion rate (27.8%) (p=0.005) were significantly higher. Five cases of congenital anomalies were detected, all belonging to group A, but this tendency was not found to be statistically significant. Conclusions.

Patient data including age, recurrence time, histopathological results, chemotherapy protocols, were obtained from the hospital database. Early paclitaxel rechallenge was defined as paclitaxel rechallenge in the thirdline after the secondline liposomal doxorubycin, late paclitaxel rechallenge was defined as treatment in further lines. <h3>Results</h3> The median age of the was 54 (range, 27–77). Median overall survival (OS) was 45 (range, 21–186) months. In survival analyses patients who underwent late rechallenge had worse overall survival (58.9 vs. 64.4 months, p:0.219) but this finding did not reach a statistical significance. In evaluation of challenges agent types patients who underwent single agent (only paclitaxel) had better OS when compared to two agents (paclitaxel + carboplatine); 67.6 vs 54.4 months (p:0.713) whereas this also did not reach a statistical significance. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Despite the later onset of approach and low number of patients the results of our study supports that early paclitaxel rechallenge may be promising in management of platine resistant recurrent high grade serous ovarian cancer. Also, single agent rechallenge may be a better option to avoid the chemotherapy related side effects with better overall survival results. <h3>Disclosures</h3> none",,,A332.2,A332,Medicine; Paclitaxel; Serous fluid; Chemotherapy; Ovarian cancer; Serous ovarian cancer; Oncology; Internal medicine; Statistical significance; Overall survival; Clinical significance; Cancer; Retrospective cohort study,,,,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/33/Suppl_3/A332.2.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.697,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.697,,10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.697,,,0,,0,true,other-oa,hybrid

It was determined that there were significant changes in sexual lives of the individuals following the illness, and that body image, role of sexuality, sexual functions and reproduction ability, which are the four important components of sexual health, were affected unfavorably to a great extent. It was determined in this study that individuals with gynecological cancer face multidimensional problems regarding sexual life. Adoption of holistic approach by health professionals in the evaluation of sexual problems of women and attempting to solve the problem are of significance.",25,3,195,204,Cancer; Reproductive health; Content analysis; Qualitative research; Sexual function; Cervical cancer; Sexual life; Human sexuality; Clinical psychology; Medicine,,,,,http://www.uhod.org/pdf/PDF_675.pdf https://app.trdizin.gov.tr/makale/TVRnM016STVPUT09/problematic-areas-related-to-sexual-life-of-individuals-with-gynecological-cancer-a-qualitative-study-in-turkey http://acikerisim.baskent.edu.tr/handle/11727/4060,http://dx.doi.org/10.4999/uhod.151090,,10.4999/uhod.151090,2783941919,,0,000-080-288-875-220; 001-833-798-039-855; 002-156-434-277-001; 003-563-888-982-455; 004-466-026-835-859; 005-170-350-052-462; 005-990-257-419-34X; 007-959-331-991-035; 010-012-803-542-534; 013-044-227-899-564; 020-476-314-161-384; 021-667-856-626-682; 024-209-221-433-001; 032-694-543-727-776; 033-991-840-196-657; 038-706-545-291-068; 039-239-321-911-703; 042-357-409-990-771; 043-778-339-679-700; 044-168-044-815-312; 049-221-931-686-256; 055-376-565-892-87X; 062-935-826-502-326; 065-615-843-401-427; 079-322-029-679-159; 083-309-151-297-849; 091-206-660-817-281; 101-643-242-820-310; 104-645-270-779-35X; 107-397-744-963-546; 119-968-186-289-826; 124-377-260-865-913; 136-569-611-507-600; 144-818-684-924-776; 149-616-362-625-112,6,true,,green

Guler,"Hypothesis: The role of oxidized regenerated methylcellulose (ORC) in the lymphocyst formation after systematic lymphadenectomy. Methods and Study Design: This was a retrospective case-control study. Patients with gynecologic cancer who underwent systematic lymphadenectomy from May 2000 to April 2006 were considered. Retroperitoneal ""no closure"" method was performed in all patients. Two groups were identified according to ORC use. The lymphocysts were evaluated via ultrasonography/computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging between the third and sixth months after surgery. Results: The overall lymphocyst incidence was found to be 75 (29.8%) of 252, and lymphocyst incidence in the ORC and control groups was 45 (30%) of 150 and 30 (29.4%) of 102, respectively. The mean (SD) total number of extracted lymph nodes in the ORC group was 27.5 (10.6), which was significantly higher than that in the control group (22.1 [10.8]; P = 0.001). Duration of drain was significantly longer in the ORC group (P = 0.028). However, when confounding variables were included into the binary logistic regression analysis for the prediction of the duration of drains, only the stage of disease predicted the duration of drains. Conclusions: Use of ORC does not seem to affect lymphocyst formation. Oxidized regenerated methylcellulose use does not affect the duration of drains, hence ORC does not seem to pose a stimulatory effect on the peritoneum.",20,1,23,27,Anatomy; Urology; Stage (cooking); Peritoneum; Lymph; Binary logistic regression analysis; Gynecologic cancer; Systematic lymphadenectomy; Incidence (epidemiology); Ultrasonography; Medicine,,"Carcinoma/epidemiology; Case-Control Studies; Cellulose, Oxidized/metabolism; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female/epidemiology; Hemostasis, Surgical/methods; Humans; Lymph Node Excision/adverse effects; Lymphocele/epidemiology; Methylcellulose/metabolism; Peritoneum/drug effects; Retrospective Studies","Cellulose, Oxidized; Surgicel; Methylcellulose",,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/20/1/23-27.full.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20130499 https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/20/1/23-27,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/igc.0b013e3181be698f,20130499,10.1111/igc.0b013e3181be698f,2025167117,,0,009-636-672-353-863; 010-543-035-936-751; 012-314-627-231-716; 028-802-096-282-357; 032-153-024-957-623; 035-395-477-842-934; 037-470-411-045-561; 067-171-017-293-389; 071-402-004-107-225; 091-343-712-647-108; 093-389-961-975-82X; 106-348-522-672-594; 115-874-184-963-378,5,false,,

However, assisted reproduction techniques might increase the likelihood of pregnancy and decrease the time interval to conception. In this report, the authors present four patients with endometrial cancer who were treated conservatively with high dose progestin. In all of the cases, the endo-myometrial junctional zone was intact with no evidence of extra-uterine spread on pelvic imaging. A total of seven intracytoplasmic sperm injection and embryo transfer cycles were performed in four patients; five healthy infants were delivered.

FRAC3D is the solver of in-house developed “Fracture and Crack Propagation Analysis System (FCPAS)” and is a finite element-based standalone program employing three-dimensional enriched finite elements. In the analyses, values of the main parameters affecting the problem, which are normalized crack depth with respect to plate thickness (a/t=0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8), crack aspect ratio (a/c=0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0) and crack inclination angle (β=0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°), are changed systematically in their realistic ranges to obtain a wide library of solutions representing the general problem and to develop empirical SIF equations that are valid for all values of the main parameters in their pre-determined ranges. This resulted in a total of 120 three-dimensional fracture analyses. The results show that as the inclination angle of the surface crack increases, mode-I SIF decreases along the crack front, while mode-II and mode-III SIFs increase up to β=45°, which contains the plane with maximum in-plane shear stress. For higher values of β, mode-II and mode-III SIFs start decreasing as expected. As the normalized crack depth increases, the normalized SIFs also increase.

Methods Patients who underwent surgery for endometrial cancer with an SLN algorithm were stratified as low-risk or high-risk according to the uterine features on the final pathology reports. Two models for low-risk patients were defined to omit side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy: strategy A included patients with endometrioid histology, grade 1–2, and Results 372 endometrial cancer patients were analyzed. 230 patients (61.8%) had endometrioid grade 1 or 2 tumors with Conclusion Reflex frozen section examination of the uterus can be a feasible option to decide whether side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy is necessary for all the patients who failed to map with an SLN algorithm. If low-risk factors are found on frozen section examination, side-specific pelvic lymphadenectomy can be omitted without compromising diagnostic efficacy for lymphatic spread.",30,7,1005,1011,Radiology; Endometrial cancer; Uterus; Sentinel lymph node; Gynecologic oncology; Lymphadenectomy; Sentinel lymph node mapping; Group study; Medicine; Frozen section procedure,endometrial neoplasms; sentinel lymph node,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Endometrioid/pathology; Endometrial Neoplasms/pathology; Female; Frozen Sections; Humans; Lymph Node Excision/statistics & numerical data; Lymph Nodes/pathology; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Sentinel Lymph Node/pathology; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy; Turkey",,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/29/ijgc-2020-001353.abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32474451 https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/early/2020/05/29/ijgc-2020-001353.full.pdf http://ijgc.bmj.com/content/30/7/1005 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32474451/ http://acikerisim.baskent.edu.tr:8080/xmlui/handle/11727/5892 https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/30/7/1005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-001353,32474451,10.1136/ijgc-2020-001353,3028942992,,0,002-654-353-590-946; 005-153-257-347-085; 005-610-863-271-704; 005-830-310-677-266; 008-365-966-586-285; 011-024-502-430-699; 011-975-581-084-694; 012-420-129-771-735; 020-742-166-984-723; 022-445-889-244-579; 030-596-850-957-49X; 031-414-158-140-869; 034-315-774-815-562; 037-616-188-786-912; 038-981-908-168-955; 044-553-238-011-76X; 045-149-789-046-709; 047-557-096-882-566; 056-143-060-381-299; 067-306-800-236-47X; 068-396-427-340-84X; 077-252-623-743-21X; 083-390-057-718-134; 085-550-641-151-213; 093-660-706-532-373; 165-779-363-158-444,5,false,,

She achieved pregnancy with two normal embryos. Two gestational sacs were observed but one of them was blighted. The patient subsequently delivered a healthy female infant. Repeated office hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling was performed after delivery. The appearance of the endometrium was normal on hysteroscopy, and the histology report was normal.

Gynecologic malignancy is the second most common cancer in elderly women, following breast cancer. These cancers usually spread locally at first, and common distant metastatic sites are the lungs, liver, spleen, and distant lymph nodes. The brain is not a usual site of metastatic involvement. Materials and methods: The study included 12 cases with various gynecologic malignancies that were retrospectively analyzed. Therapeutic modalities, survival, and time between initial surgery and brain metastasis were recorded. Results: The mean survival was 41.4 months in 6 patients with ovarian cancer versus 27.7 months in those with other gynecological cancers. At the time of brain metastasis, the CA-125 level was elevated in all of the patients, except one that had cervical cancer. The mean CA-125 level was 202 IU mL-1. There were no differences in the mean overall survival between the patients that underwent surgical resection and those that received medical treatment. Conclusion: Brain metastasis can occur in all gynecologic cancers and has a poor prognosis, despite multimodal treatment.",42,3,385,394,Cancer; Internal medicine; Oncology; Brain metastasis; Cervical cancer; Single Center; Ovarian cancer; Medical treatment; Gynecologic cancer; Breast cancer; Medicine,,,,,https://app.trdizin.gov.tr/makale/TVRReE9EZzRPQT09/outcomes-in-12-gynecologic-cancer-patients-with-brain-metastasis-a-single-center-s-experience https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/128513 https://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/medical/issues/sag-12-42-3/sag-42-3-3-1101-1382.pdf https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/pub/tbtkmedical/issue/12298/147100,https://app.trdizin.gov.tr/makale/TVRReE9EZzRPQT09/outcomes-in-12-gynecologic-cancer-patients-with-brain-metastasis-a-single-center-s-experience,,,1200434375,,0,000-367-300-550-727; 000-401-957-892-998; 002-593-835-152-90X; 003-309-842-179-903; 003-747-338-411-742; 009-985-198-681-020; 010-442-612-288-342; 010-703-917-622-113; 016-371-260-940-511; 017-850-397-046-566; 019-205-773-099-567; 020-324-926-370-280; 021-327-649-735-666; 023-627-755-577-654; 024-017-707-589-35X; 028-193-178-812-533; 030-540-974-311-823; 031-076-434-978-635; 031-450-443-478-832; 032-758-611-328-954; 037-193-664-834-814; 041-056-317-823-09X; 047-614-032-032-202; 047-714-680-375-762; 048-020-417-242-567; 053-498-452-656-988; 056-457-978-414-850; 058-060-303-378-721; 060-400-878-229-268; 062-042-580-043-247; 076-305-124-215-439; 079-415-382-670-414; 083-985-307-359-123; 090-699-915-214-565; 105-436-025-894-165; 114-855-752-543-014; 124-888-022-595-81X; 126-963-761-807-943; 134-934-845-190-407; 147-984-814-571-730; 175-443-122-650-845,6,false,,

FCPAS uses finite element models to calculate three-dimensional mixed mode stress intensity factors and other sub-modules to predict shapes of the incrementally growing crack fronts and the resulting fatigue crack propagation lives. The evolving crack surfaces are generated by successively adding the incremental growth surfaces and re-meshing and re-solving the finite element model using the standalone program FRAC3D, a finite element-based standalone program employing three-dimensional enriched finite elements. The results show that the fracture surfaces evolve into a mode-I type three-dimensional crack as expected. Very good agreements are obtained between the results of the current studies and those of numerical applications in terms of both evolving crack surfaces and crack propagation lives. Therefore, it is concluded that the applied method is capable of accurately predicting linear elastic three-dimensional mixed mode fatigue crack propagation problems.",21,,21,30,Finite element method; Materials science; Mixed mode; Incremental growth; Fatigue crack propagation; Linear elasticity; Fracture (geology); Stress intensity factor; Mechanics; Fracture mechanics,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452321619305566,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prostr.2019.12.082,,10.1016/j.prostr.2019.12.082,2999267748,,0,000-010-226-975-265; 008-480-937-887-218; 008-745-658-391-480; 017-684-104-157-393; 020-177-628-630-286; 024-356-222-089-222; 030-326-839-210-977; 031-524-407-381-522; 048-804-119-390-209; 071-460-423-219-972; 075-875-862-570-449; 077-440-495-361-628; 078-672-473-718-736; 101-819-753-596-900; 103-796-112-146-778; 115-532-970-049-452; 122-564-609-505-680; 123-179-061-040-691; 130-927-876-977-092; 137-610-302-523-154; 139-632-010-321-729; 140-499-144-907-253; 161-563-747-308-300,5,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

METHODS A multicenter, retrospective department database review was performed to identify patients with stage III nonserous EOC who had undergone maximal or optimal primary CRS followed by six cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy at seven gynecological oncology centers in Turkey. Demographic, clinicopathological and survival data were collected. RESULTS A total of 218 women met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 64 (29.4%) patients had endometrioid, 61 (28%) had mucinous, 54 (24.8%) had clear-cell and 39 (17.9%) had mixed epithelial tumors. Fifty-five (25.2%) patients underwent maximal CRS, whereas 163 (74.8%) had optimal debulking. With a median follow-up of 31.5 months, the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 34.8% and 44.2%, respectively. Bilaterality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.44, 95% CI 1.01-2.056; P = 0.04), age (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.176-4.323; P = 0.014) and maximal cytoreduction (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.202-0.58; P < 0.001) were found to be independent prognostic factors for PFS. However, age (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.215-5.591; P = 0.014) and maximal cytoreduction (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.166-0.615; P < 0.001) were defined as independent prognostic factors for OS. CONCLUSION The extent of CRS seems to be the only modifiable prognostic factor associated with stage III nonserous EOC.

The heard sound is recorded when it is repeated by human voice, and its frequency is compared to the frequencies of existing sounds in the computer to obtain measurement results. The first version of the program to be developed used piano notes in the range of B3-D5. The program generates measurement results in graphic form, corresponding to notes sung. In addition, the frequency results are shown in the information display. One of the main objectives of the study is to develop a measurement system that could be applied in music special aptitude tests. In music aptitude tests, in the questions about sounds repeating, the jury’s perception is altered by factors such as fatigue, and candidates’ measurement results are affected by this problem. This program seeks to eliminate this negative effect in the measurements results of the aptitude test. The first version of the program developed in this study was tested on 10 people. The Pearson correlation analysis was performed with the aim of examining the relationship between achievement levels of students in one voice field and fixed frequency values. The result of this analysis was a meaningful, positive and high-level relationship between fixed values of 16 notes frequencies in the range of B3-D5 and singing values of the students regarding these 16 notes.; ; 	 ; ; 	Key words: Music education, music aptitude test, MATLAB, Fourier transform, aptitude test program.",9,20,1025,1036,Statistics; Music education; Psychology; Human voice; Range (music); MATLAB; Speech recognition; Field (computer science); Singing; Aptitude; Software design,,,,,https://www.academicjournals.org/journal/ERR/article-full-text-pdf/35F05F548100 https://academicjournals.org/journal/ERR/article-abstract/35F05F548100,http://dx.doi.org/10.5897/err2014.1904,,10.5897/err2014.1904,2313418636,,0,019-231-056-881-969; 028-739-777-931-448; 048-231-803-068-843; 076-592-197-052-460; 081-150-715-092-052; 088-795-411-681-774; 092-611-368-324-047; 098-410-406-331-326; 104-356-064-342-201; 196-976-877-432-786,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

Utku Dogan; Türkan Küçükali,"What used to be called vulvar dystrophy now is termed nonneoplastic epithelial disorders of the vulva. Within this category, the association of lichen sclerosus with varying degrees of squamous cell hyperplasia is referred to as mixed disease. This retrospective study compared responses to treatment with testosterone and clobetasol in 83 women having biopsy-proved vulvar mixed disease. All patients were initially treated with topical fluorinated corticosteroids for 6 weeks. They were then treated with either 2% testosterone propionate in petrolatum (n = 44) or 0.05% clobetasol 17-propionate cream (n = 39), each applied once a day. After symptoms were optimally controlled, twice weekly applications were advised for 3 months and treatment then was continued on an as-needed basis. The major complaints were vulvar itching and burning or discomfort. Remission rates after 6 months were 82% in women treated with testosterone and 93% in those treated with clobetasol. Disease recurred in 8% of patients: 13% of women treated with testosterone and 5% of clobetasol-treated patients. The median time to recurrence was 9 months. Persistent disease was documented histologically in 60% of patients whose symptoms did not respond to treatment. Skinning vulvectomy ultimately was performed in 2 patients with recurrent disease and 2 with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia I-II or atypical squamous hyperplasia. Treatment was not associated with steroid vulvar atrophy or other serious complications. Both topical treatments evaluated in this retrospective study yielded excellent remission rates. Clobetasol led to a higher remission rate and lower recurrence rate than did testosterone therapy, but the differences were not statistically significant. Patients with mixed disease who fail to respond symptomatically should have a vulvar biopsy to rule out atypical components.",62,9,581,582,Surgery; Dermatology; Vulva; Lichen sclerosus; Hyperplasia; Testosterone (patch); Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; Testosterone propionate; Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus; Vulvar Dystrophy; Medicine,,,,,http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&an=00006254-200709000-00015 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=19019602,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ogx.0000280192.39997.ad,,10.1097/01.ogx.0000280192.39997.ad,1984337195,,0,,0,false,,

The subjects, whose mean age was 27 years and mean gravidity was 2.8, had a total of 136 pregnancies during the study. The interval from surgery to pregnancy ranged from 4 to 191 months and averaged 52.5 months. Seventy-one women had a replaced mitral valve, 10 had a replaced aortic valve, and 18 had both valves replaced. Mechanical valves were inserted in 92 cases, and porcine heterograft prostheses were inserted in 9 Sixty-eight women received oral anticoagulation with warfarin during gestation. Sixteen others received heparin, and 17 were not anticoagulated. Coumadin anticoagulation was designed to produce a prothrombin time 1.5 to 2.5 times the value in the control sample in the earlier part of the study (1970-1998), and a level 2.5 to 3.5 time control more recently. Heparin therapy maintained a partial thromboplastin time of 1.5 to 2.5 times control. Comparable perinatal mortality rates were recorded in the three treatment groups, and there were no significant differences in fetal outcomes. Both spontaneous abortions and stillbirths were most frequent in warfarin-treated women, but not to a statistically significant degree. Mothers of two of the three infants with intraventricular hemorrhage had received continuous heparin therapy, and one had received warfarin. All five fetal malformations were in infants exposed to warfarin, but this was not a significant effect. One of five maternal deaths was caused by massive thromboembolism in a woman given heparin. Four of six women with thromboembolic events received warfarin, and two received heparin. Eight of 10 women with antenatal bleeding of unknown origin had taken warfarin, and 2 had taken heparin All episodes subsided without intervention. Wound or vaginal hematoma formation after delivery and the need for transfusion were more prevalent in the heparin group, but there were no significant group differences in maternal deaths, thromboembolism, antenatal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure, Despite the possibility that warfarin anticoagulation may have some teratogenic potential, it does ensure safe and simple anticoagulation for pregnant women who have had cardiac valve replacement. Heparin may carry lower fetal risk, but at the same time it may put the mother at jeopardy of bleeding or fatal thromboembolism unless she is closely monitored.",57,3,138,139,Surgery; Warfarin; Heparin; Anticoagulant; Partial thromboplastin time; Atrial fibrillation; Pregnancy; Prothrombin time; Aortic valve; Medicine,,,,,http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&an=00006254-200203000-00003 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=13604593,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00006254-200203000-00003,,10.1097/00006254-200203000-00003,2315004653,,0,,0,false,,

Yaren,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Some of the fatigue tests performed using the standard compact tension (CT) and a non‐standard specimen made of rolled 7075 aluminium alloy exhibit fatigue crack growth (FCG) lagging in a small region along the crack front. Through‐thickness microstructural evaluation shows that material grains in this region did not flatten as much as other regions. In the non‐standard specimen, surface cracks are either grown under fatigue loading or broken under monotonically increasing quasi‐static loads at different crack sizes. The aforementioned lagging also exists in a narrow region of 3‐D FCG for specimens with microstructural through‐thickness non‐uniformity. A more important feature for this type of specimen with surface crack is the deflection of fast fracture direction into the grain interfaces, namely from L‐T orientation to S‐L and S‐T directions. It is proved that this is due to significant levels of second principal stresses near the free surface for small cracks and lower fracture toughness of the material in S‐L and S‐T directions.</jats:p>",43,9,2071,2084,Composite material; Materials science; Alloy; Crack size; Fatigue crack propagation; Fracture (geology),,,,The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ffe.13284,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ffe.13284,,10.1111/ffe.13284,3038035295,,0,005-330-210-680-889; 011-780-735-009-946; 024-280-575-704-608; 031-238-834-832-503; 045-903-132-216-023; 050-133-681-612-283; 066-827-546-419-701; 068-710-099-928-873; 072-005-633-123-807; 073-692-426-647-679; 090-936-970-653-460; 120-829-899-363-198; 122-564-609-505-680; 132-146-544-588-884; 139-632-010-321-729,2,false,,

Early detection and administration of appropriate therapy is still a lifesaving procedure, especially for cervical cancer. The most common screening method for cervical cancer is still the cervical cytology (Pap-test). We aim to find out the advantages and disadvantages of a recently developed method, which is called as TruScreen®.Methods: Two different approaches had been used (conventional Pap test and TruScreen®), and 1438 patients were included in the study. Of these, 819 had been screened with TruScreen®. All eligible patients were firstly screened using TruScreen® and then using the Pap-test. Each patient with an abnormal TruScreen® result was referred to colposcopy room, where she was re-evaluated using colposcopy.Results: The rate of abnormal smear result was 1.04%, and the corresponding percentage was calculated as 0.62% in LSIL, 0.34% in ASCUS, and 0.069% in HSIL. A total of 819 patients underwent TruScreen®, and the results were abnormal in 261 patients and normal in 558 patients Interception rates for cervical dysplasia with TruScreen® have been found to be better than the conventional Pap test. The need for colposcopy dramatically increased with the use of TruScreen®. Use of TruScreen® alone was not found to be cost effective.Conclusions: Combination with other methods of screening would decrease the cost of the process. Further studies needed to find out the possible effects for the combination of TruScreen® with other testing methods.</jats:p>",9,5,1900,,Internal medicine; Oncology; Cervical cancer; Screening method; Medicine,,,,,https://www.ijrcog.org/index.php/ijrcog/article/viewFile/8241/5499,http://dx.doi.org/10.18203/2320-1770.ijrcog20201777,,10.18203/2320-1770.ijrcog20201777,3022443686,,0,,0,true,,gold

CANADA Inc.,Canada,Ali Ayhan; Husnu Celik; Cagatay Taskiran; Gurkan Bozdag; T. Aksu,"The rate of ovarian tumour diagnosis in reproductive age woman has increased parallel to the improvements in diagnostic methods and regular gynaecological visits. Because of this organ saving surgical procedures for the preservation of reproductive and endocrine functions have gained more interest. Conservative surgical approaches for ovarian tumours after surgical staging include cystectomy, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy plus contralateral cystectomy. Ovarian tumours diagnosed in young ages tend to be low-stage low-grade malignancies. This not only enables but also necessitates preserving the fertility of women who have not completed their family. In invasive ovarian cancer, fertility saving surgery is confined to early-stage and low-grade disease. But, it also had been reported in advanced stages (up to Stage IIIc). Candidates for those procedures were selected according to the FIGO stage, grade, ploidy state, histological subtypes and patients' desire. Adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary for high-risk patients. The rate of recurrence following conservative and radical surgical procedures in low-stage and low-grade tumours are 9% and 11.6%, respectively; and disease-free and overall survival rates do not differ significantly. Prognosis of borderline ovarian tumours is excellent. Five and 20-year survival rates are 95% and 80%, respectively. Management of borderline tumours has evolved significantly in the last few decades. In contrast to invasive ovarian cancer, borderline tumours can be operated on conservatively at all stages. Chemotherapy is rarely prescribed even in advanced stages. Eighty percent of malignant germ cell tumours are diagnosed less than 30 years of age, and 70-75% of patients have Stage I disease. Conservative surgery is generally used in malignant germ cell tumours even in advanced stages. The relation between ovulation induction and tumour recurrence is not consistent in the literature. Spontaneous pregnancy rates following fertility saving surgery has been reported as 60-88%. Because of this over-treatment of these patients for fertility should be avoided. Briefly, fertility saving surgery can be performed safely in germ cell, borderline and early stage epithelial ovarian tumours in selected cases. Any increment in the rate of tumour recurrence following ovulation induction has not yet been demonstrated. Menstrual irregularities caused by chemotherapy are transient. The congenital malformation rate of ovarian cancer patients is slightly higher than that of the normal population, but no significant difference has been observed between patients who received or did not receive chemotherapy.",24,3-4,223,232,Surgery; Stage (cooking); Cystectomy; Infertility; Pregnancy; Ovarian cancer; Ovulation induction; Stage IIIC; Fertility; Medicine,,"Adult; Biopsy, Needle; Carcinoma/pathology; Female; Humans; Infertility, Female/prevention & control; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness/pathology; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/pathology; Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology; Ovariectomy/methods; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/pathology; Pregnancy Outcome; Pregnancy Rate; Prognosis; Risk Assessment",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12807228 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/12807228 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12807228/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12807228,12807228,,174167140,,0,,44,false,,

Patients and Methods: The study employed a qualitative design from May to October of 2010, in a private university hospitals outpatient gnecologic oncology clinic in Ankara, Turkey. Content analysis with an inductive approach had been used to analyze 32 interviews that served as the data base for this study. Interview form that focused on what gynecologic cancer women felt to living with a colostomy. Results: Findings also reveal that gynecologic cancer patients with colostomy experience many uneasy feelings that affect their emotional state. The content analysis resulted in the development of two thematic units. The first we described as “To experience the consequences of stoma as a gynecologic cancer patients”. The second was “suffering experienced-being challenged the consequences of the stoma”, and the third was “promote self management-normalization of the new condition”. For the psychological support, family and friends’ support has been mentioned as the most important part that can release their anxiety. Conclusions: We concluded that a having stoma was difficult for the women. The emotional state of the women when they get colostomy was typically characterized by fear, and worry about their current process. Body image, self-esteem, social activity, sexuality were the aspects that most affected the patients.

In this respect, ""social support"" has become a key tool in the patients' coping with the aforementioned risk factors as an important contributor to their well-being. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between social support and the level of anxiety, depression, and quality of life of Turkish women with gynecologic cancer. METHODS In a hospital in Turkey, 187 women with a diagnosis of gynecologic cancer comprised a convenience sample and completed 4 study instruments in a cross-sectional design. RESULTS Statistically significant correlations among type of perceived social support, quality of life, anxiety, and depression (P < .001) were found. While high social support was associated with increased quality of life, it was also associated with reduced anxiety and depression rates. CONCLUSION Our study showed that the type of perceived social support by the patients with cancer had significant effect on depression, anxiety, and quality of life. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Social support is a powerful tool that can mediate the effects of difficult life stressors and decrease the incidence of mood disorders, and, therefore, greater importance should be attached to it in the realm of cancer treatment. Supported by the collaborative efforts of family members and healthcare professionals, cancer patients will more easily cope with the drawbacks of their state.",35,3,229,235,Psychiatry; Psychosocial; Mood disorders; Social support; Turkish; Gynecologic cancer; Anxiety depression; Anxiety; Clinical psychology; Medicine; Coping (psychology),,"Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female/psychology; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life/psychology; Risk Factors; Social Support; Turkey/epidemiology",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946902 https://journals.lww.com/00002820-201205000-00009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ncc.0b013e31822c47bd,21946902,10.1097/ncc.0b013e31822c47bd,1980933924,,0,000-197-179-684-838; 005-412-515-346-119; 007-415-952-217-880; 008-024-198-137-747; 010-229-783-956-058; 021-204-265-812-693; 023-403-525-707-035; 025-736-313-815-729; 038-354-842-882-984; 051-033-125-093-986; 052-323-327-385-348; 083-736-132-776-613; 086-252-945-038-763; 097-900-668-290-136; 114-982-223-749-545; 122-061-149-570-46X; 132-552-331-001-940; 145-335-731-415-174,60,false,,

However, systematic lymphadenectomy may cause significant morbidity. In recent years, the use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with indocyanine green (ICG) has been accepted to avoid the morbidity of lymphadenectomy. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a novel injection technique in detection of sentinel lymph nodes in women with endometrial cancer. <h3>Methods</h3> A total of 214 patients with endometrial cancer underwent sentinel lymph node mapping using ICG. ICG was injected into the uterine cervix at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions, submucosally and to the level of junction between uterine cervix and isthmus in group 1(n=107) and to the uterine cervix at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions according to conventional Memorial Sloan Kettering algorithm in group 2(n=107). All the patients in group 2 selected by propensity matching. None of the patients underwent a re-injection neither in group 1 nor group 2. <h3>Results</h3> There was no significant difference between baseline characteristics of two groups. The groups were similar in terms of stage, type of tumor, BMI and lymphovascular space invasion. The bilateral detection rates were 94.4% and 76.6% in group 1 and group 2, respectively (p=0.003). No lymph node or lymphatic vessels were identified in only one patient with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in group 1. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Deep cervical injection technique significantly increases bilateral SLN detection rate in endometrial cancer patients.",,,A110.1,A110,Indocyanine green; Medicine; Endometrial cancer; Sentinel lymph node; Lymphadenectomy; Cervical cancer; Lymph node; Lymph; Cervix; Cancer; Lymphatic system; Breast cancer; Surgery; Radiology; Internal medicine; Pathology,,,,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/32/Suppl_3/A110.1.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2022-igcs.246,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2022-igcs.246,,10.1136/ijgc-2022-igcs.246,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

However, the researches performed in the last two decades have begun to discuss about the safety of these drugs and the risks associated with their use. Especially, the potential neoplastic effects of these drugs are increasingly questioned. The studies have discussed whether there is an association between the exposure to ovulation-inducing drugs and the incidence of various cancers. Moreover, several studies have been performed to reveal whether there is an increased risk of childhood cancers in children conceived after fertility treatment. The point we reached through the available data is that the risk of breast, uterine and invasive ovarian cancers is not increased, but the risk of borderline ovarian tumors might increase after such a therapy. The risk of cancer has been found similar for children conceived after fertility treatment and those conceived naturally. It should also be kept in mind that cancers are overdiagnosed in infertile women population because of the close medical surveillance, which may also contribute to the early detection of cancers. Although it is still early to state the last words on this topic, the possible association should be addressed when obtaining an informed consent before starting treatment.",83,12,1104,1111,Medicine; Fertility; Infertility; Incidence (geometry); Cancer; Gynecology; Breast cancer; Population; Oncology; Obstetrics; Pregnancy; Internal medicine; Physics; Environmental health; Biology; Optics; Genetics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/j.0001-6349.2004.00669.x,,10.1080/j.0001-6349.2004.00669.x,,,0,,9,false,,

Methodology We reviewed all myomectomy and hysterectomy operations performed with a pre-operative diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma at four tertiary centres, from January 2013 until December 2017, in Ankara, Turkey. The medical records of occult uterine sarcoma patients were analyzed to determine prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results A total 18604 women underwent hysterectomy or myomectomy during the study period. There were 56 cases of occult uterine sarcomas (51 uterine leiomyosarcomas, and five endometrial stromal sarcomas). The incidence of occult uterine sarcoma was 0.30% (56/18604) or approximately 1/332. The median DFS was 31.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.6–52.3 months). The 3-year and 5-year DFS rates were 44.1% and 34.0%, respectively. The 3-year and 5-year OS rates were 68.8% and 50.0%, respectively. For 5-year DFS, stage of the disease (stage IA vs. more advanced stages; p=0.007), rapidly growing myoma (p=0.01) and complete surgical staging at initial operation (p=0.02) were found to be statistically significant in univariate analysis. However, only stage of the disease (Hazard Ratio: 3.45, 95% Confidence Interval 1.13–10.49; p=0.02) remained as an independent prognostic factor for decreased DFS in multivariate analysis. Conclusion Our results indicated that the incidence of occult uterine sarcoma was 0.3% (1/332) in women operated for presumed uterine leiomyoma. Early and complete surgical resection might offer better DFS for these patients.

Study Design: A multicenter, retrospective, department database review was performed to identify lymphovascular space invasion-negative and lymphovascular space invasion-positive stage IIIC endometrioid endometrial cancer at five gynecological oncology centers in Turkey. Demographic, clinicopathological and survival data were collected. Cases and controls were matched in terms of age at diagnosis, grade of tumor, depth of myometrial invasion, sub-stage and adjuvant treatment. Results: Forty-one patients in the case group and 82 patients in the control group were eligible for the study. The 5-year OS rates were 94.4% in the lymphovascular space invasion-negative group and 77.2% in the LVSI-positive group (p=0.058). Advanced age (58 years) (HR 3.73; 95% CI: 1.19-11.69, p=0.02), grade 3 tumor (HR 2.57; 95% CI: 1.002-6.62, p=0.048) and cervical involvement (HR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.03-6.67, p= 0.04) appeared to be as independent predictors of decreased overall survival (OS). There was a trend towards statistical significance between the presence of lymphovascular space invasion and OS in regression analysis (HR 3.10; 95% CI 0.90-10.67, p=0.05). Recurrence rates were 17.0% (7/41) and 24.4% (20/82) in lymphovascular space invasion-negative and lymphovascular space invasion-positive groups, respectively (p=0.48). There were 5 cases of retroperitoneal recurrences in the lymphovascular space invasion-positive group and no retroperitoneal recurrence among lymphovascular space invasion-negative women. Conclusion: Lymphovascular space invasion status seems to be of borderline significance for OS in stage IIIC endometrioid endometrial cancer and impacts recurrence patterns as retroperitoneal recurrences are strongly related to positive lymphovascular space invasion status.",27,1,1,7,Internal medicine; Case-control study; Endometrial cancer; Lymphovascular; Gynecological oncology; Stage IIIC; In patient; Overall survival; Statistical significance; Medicine; Gastroenterology,,,,,https://gorm.com.tr/index.php/GORM/article/view/925 https://www.gorm.com.tr/index.php/GORM/article/download/925/788 http://gorm.com.tr/index.php/GORM/article/view/925,http://dx.doi.org/10.21613/gorm.2019.925,,10.21613/gorm.2019.925,2946048596,,0,,0,true,cc-by,gold

The effect of chemoradiotherapy may be enhanced by immunotherapy. ENGOT-cx11/GOG-3047/KEYNOTE-A18 (NCT04221945) assessed efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab + concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). <h3>Methodology</h3> Eligible patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, high-risk LACC (FIGO 2014 stage IB2-IIB with node-positive disease or stage III-IVA) were randomized 1:1 to receive 5 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo Q3W + CCRT, then 15 cycles of pembrolizumab 400 mg or placebo Q6W. The CCRT regimen included 5 cycles (with optional sixth dose) of cisplatin 40 mg/m2 Q1W + EBRT then brachytherapy. Patients were stratified by planned EBRT type (IMRT/VMAT vs non-IMRT/non-VMAT), stage at screening (stage IB2-IIB vs III-IVA) and planned total radiotherapy dose. Primary endpoints were PFS per RECIST v1.1 by investigator and OS. <h3>Results</h3> 1060 patients were randomized to pembrolizumab+CCRT (n=529) or placebo+CCRT (n=531). At the protocol-specified first interim analysis (January 9, 2023, data cutoff), median follow-up was 17.9 mo (range, 0.9–31.0). Pembrolizumab+CCRT showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS vs placebo+CCRT. 24-mo PFS was 67.8% with pembrolizumab+CCRT vs 57.3% with placebo+CCRT; median PFS was not reached in either group (HR=0.70 [95% CI, 0.55–0.89; P=0.0020]); results were consistent across all prespecified subgroups. With only 103 events (42.9% maturity), the addition of pembrolizumab to CCRT showed a favorable trend in OS (HR=0.73 [95% CI, 0.49–1.07]); these data have not crossed the boundary of statistical significance. Grade ≥3 TRAE incidence was 67.0% in the pembrolizumab+CCRT group and 60.0% in the placebo+CCRT group. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Pembrolizumab+CCRT showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS and a favorable trend in OS compared with placebo+CCRT in patients with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer and had a manageable safety profile. These data suggest pembrolizumab+CCRT can be considered as a new standard of care for this population. <h3>Disclosures</h3> Disclosures are provided via the ESGO COI Disclosure forms.",,,A2.1,A2,Pembrolizumab; Cervical cancer; Chemoradiotherapy; Medicine; Phase (matter); Oncology; Internal medicine; Cancer; Physics; Immunotherapy; Quantum mechanics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2024-esgo.3,,10.1136/ijgc-2024-esgo.3,,,0,,0,false,,

F. Nied,"The analysis of three-dimensional crack problems using enriched crack tip elements is examined in this paper. It is demonstrated that the enriched finite element approach is a very effective technique for obtaining stress intensity factors for general three-dimensional crack problems. The influence of compatibility, integration, element shape function order, and mesh refinement on solution convergence is investigated to ascertain the accuracy of the numerical results. It is shown that integration order has the greatest impact on solution accuracy. Sample results are presented for semi-circular surface cracks and compared with previously obtained solutions available in the literature. Good agreement is obtained between the different numerical solutions, except in the small zone near the free surface where previously published results have often neglected the change in the stress singularity at the free surface. The enriched crack tip element appears to be particularly effective in this region, since boundary conditions can be easily imposed on the stress intensity factors to accurately represent the correct free surface condition.

The differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia which is frequently seen together with the invasive squamous cell carcinoma can be confused with some benign lesions. To analyse p16, p53, and Ki-67 expression characteristics of different histological types of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia is aimed in this study. Methods: In this study, immunohistochemical analysis of 18 vulvectomy cases with p16, p53, and Ki-67 was performed. Results: Of 18 patient who underwent vulvectomy, 9 had invasive squamous cell carcinoma and 9 vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. 3 additional vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia lesions were found accompanying the invasive squamous cell carcinomas. Mean Ki-67 PI was 32,3% in usual type (human papilloma virus-related) vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia cases (n:9), and 26,4% in differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia cases (n:3)(p>0,05). Mean p16 staining degree was 2,6 for usual type vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias. No p53 expression was present in squamous cell hyperplasia or lichen sclerosis lesions. Conclusions: Ki-67 PI does not have significant value in recognizing vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia usual type and differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. p53 positivity can be of value in distinguishing especially differentiated type vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia from benign lesions.",1,1,24,,Internal medicine; Pathology; Oncology; Immunohistochemistry; Vulva; Papilloma; Hyperplasia; Vulvectomy; Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma; P53 expression; Medicine,,,,,https://www.hoajonline.com/jctr/abstract/2049-7962/1/24 https://www.hoajonline.com/journals/pdf/2049-7962-1-24.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.7243/2049-7962-1-24,,10.7243/2049-7962-1-24,2165063257,,0,000-540-498-474-550; 004-714-022-719-48X; 011-525-513-300-465; 013-165-219-229-895; 014-571-428-290-553; 020-047-960-383-576; 027-318-965-755-750; 038-486-248-201-036; 039-211-512-350-924; 046-629-495-662-61X; 056-671-663-130-949; 057-957-339-131-595; 067-937-750-387-907; 077-718-192-145-219; 099-653-634-865-445; 103-557-701-161-281; 111-473-083-817-248; 112-238-037-393-620; 115-320-955-945-203,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

Methods A multicenter, retrospective department database review was performed to identify patients with UCCC who underwent surgical treatment between 1997 and 2016 at 8 Gynecologic Oncology Centers. Demographic, clinicopathological, and survival data were collected. Results A total of 232 women with UCCC were identified. Of these, 53 (22.8%) had surgically-staged non-invasive UCCC. Twelve patients (22.6%) were upstaged at surgical assessment, including a 5.6% rate of lymphatic dissemination (3/53). Of those, 1 had stage IIIA, 1 had stage IIIC1, 1 had stage IIIC2, and 9 had stage IVB disease. Of the 9 women with stage IVB disease, 5 had isolated omental involvement indicating omentum as the most common metastatic site. UCCC limited only to the endometrium with no extra-uterine disease was confirmed in 41 women (73.3%) after surgical staging. Of those, 13 women (32%) were observed without adjuvant treatment whereas 28 patients (68%) underwent adjuvant therapy. The 5-year disease-free survival rates for patients with and without adjuvant treatment were 100.0% vs. 74.1%, respectively (p=0.060). Conclusion Extra-uterine disease may occur in the absence of myometrial invasion (MMI), therefore comprehensive surgical staging including omentectomy should be the standard of care for women with UCCC regardless of the depth of MMI. Larger cohorts are needed in order to clarify the necessity of adjuvant treatment for women with UCCC truly confined to the endometrium.",28,4,0,,Internal medicine; Surgery; Oncology; Stage (cooking); Chemotherapy; Adjuvant therapy; Endometrium; Gynecologic oncology; Uterine clear-cell carcinoma; Adenocarcinoma; Radiation therapy; Medicine,Radiotherapy  Adjuvant; Adenocarcinoma  Clear Cell; Chemotherapy  Adjuvant; Endometrium; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Uterine Diseases,"Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell/secondary; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aorta; Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Omentum/pathology; Pelvis; Peritoneal Neoplasms/secondary; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; Turkey; Uterine Neoplasms/pathology",,,https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5447148 https://www.ejgo.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2017.28.e49 https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3802/jgo.2017.28.e49 https://www.komci.org/GSResult.php?RID=2413433&DT=1 https://synapse.koreamed.org/upload/SynapseData/PDFData/1114jgo/jgo-28-e49.pdf http://acikerisim.baskent.edu.tr/handle/11727/3480 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28541637/ https://ejgo.org/Synapse/Data/PDFData/1114JGO/jgo-28-e49.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28541637 https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2017.28.e49,http://dx.doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2017.28.e49,28541637,10.3802/jgo.2017.28.e49,2614369691,PMC5447148,0,000-463-008-152-22X; 007-372-484-198-49X; 008-385-744-266-25X; 012-776-909-261-813; 016-566-138-696-252; 024-150-956-144-979; 031-294-556-129-565; 031-578-410-682-418; 032-508-815-366-627; 033-333-582-097-466; 037-438-819-242-235; 038-638-987-031-042; 038-661-866-005-791; 064-473-822-351-662; 065-192-491-874-025; 068-939-318-426-052; 079-118-489-537-989; 086-465-361-155-869; 086-766-217-673-249; 087-575-330-873-626; 124-678-289-264-889; 176-378-543-969-30X,12,true,cc-by-nc,gold

PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective study was performed using 10 gynecological oncology department databases. Patients who met the following criteria were included in the study: (a) endometrioid-type histology, (b) histological grade 1 or 2, (c) no or < 50% myometrial invasion, (d) no intraoperative evidence of extrauterine spread, and (e) the patient underwent at least a pelvic lymphadenectomy. Recurrence was detected in 56 patients who were histologically diagnosed with low-risk EC, and these patients made up the case group. A total of 224 patients with low-risk EC without recurrence were selected (control group) using a dependent random sampling method. The case and control groups were match-paired in terms of grade, stage, and operative technique. RESULTS Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (odds ratio (OR) 5.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-16.9; p = 0.001) and primary tumor diameter (PTD) ≥ 20 mm (OR 6.6, 95% CI 2.7-15.8; p < 0.001) were found to be independent risk factors for recurrence in women with low-risk EC. CONCLUSION The presence of LVSI and PTD ≥ 20 mm seem to be significant risk factors for recurrence in women with low-risk EC.",41,7-8,466,470,Internal medicine; Case-control study; Odds ratio; Retrospective cohort study; Stage (cooking); Endometrial cancer; Primary tumor; Lymphovascular; Confidence interval; Medicine; Gastroenterology,Low-risk endometrial cancer; Lymphovascular space invasion; Primary tumor diameter,"Aged; Case-Control Studies; Chemoradiotherapy; Endometrial Neoplasms/pathology; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Lymph Node Excision; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30056447 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30056447/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000488112,30056447,10.1159/000488112,2884866200,,0,,15,false,,

The role of adjuvant treatment in these patients remains controversial, based on a single randomised GOG 92 study performed more than 20 years ago. The objective of our study was to evaluate if adjuvant (chemo)radiation is associated with a disease-free survival benefit after radical surgery in patients with IR cervical cancer. <h3>Methodology</h3> We analysed data from patients who met criteria for intermediate risk cervical cancer (tumour 2–4 cm +LVSI OR tumour size &gt;4 cm; N0; no parametrial invasion; clear surgical margins), underwent primary surgical treatment with a curative intent between 2007 – 2016, and were registered in the international multicentre Surveillance in Cervical CANcer (SCCAN) study. Administration of the adjuvant treatment stratified the cohort in two subgroups in which oncological outcomes were evaluated and compared using log-rank test. <h3>Results</h3> Of 692 patients included in the analysis, 274 (39.6%) patients received no adjuvant treatment (AT-) and 418 (60.4%) were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (AT+). The 5-year disease-free survival was 83.2% and 80.3% (<i>P</i>=0.365) and corresponding overall survival 88.7% and 89.0% (<i>P</i> =0.281) in AT- and AT+ groups, respectively (figure 1). Separate sub-group analyses in patients with tumour ≥4 cm and 2–4 cm +LVSI also did not reveal any significant survival benefit of combined treatment in either of the sub-groups. Adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy was not identified as an independent prognostic factor in the cohort or any of the sub-groups. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Radical surgery alone achieved equal disease-free and overall survival in patients with intermediate-risk, early-stage cervical cancer as compared with combined treatment composed of radical surgery and adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy.",,,A44.1,A44,Medicine; Cervical cancer; Internal medicine; Oncology; Adjuvant; Chemoradiotherapy; Adjuvant therapy; Radiation therapy; Stage (stratigraphy); Lymphovascular invasion; Cancer; Surgery; Metastasis; Paleontology; Biology,,,,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/32/Suppl_2/A44.1.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2022-esgo.96,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2022-esgo.96,,10.1136/ijgc-2022-esgo.96,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

Results from finite element analyses and fracture loads, crack deflection angles obtained from the experiments are presented. To simulate the real conditions in the experiments, contacts are defined between the contact surfaces of the loading devices, specimen and loading pins. Modeling, meshing and the solution of the problem involving the whole assembly, i.e., loading devices, pins and the specimen, with contact mechanics are performed using ANSYSTM. Then, CTS specimen is analyzed separately using a submodeling approach, in which three-dimensional enriched finite elements are used in FRAC3D solver to calculate the resulting stress intensity factors along the crack front. Having performed the detailed computational and experimental studies on the CTS specimen, a new specimen type together with its loading device is also proposed that has smaller dimensions compared to the regular CTS specimen.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA positivity in regional lymph nodes has been proposed as a risk factor for recurrence in a number of studies. The aim of our study was to determine the correlation between well-known prognostic factors and HPV DNA positivity in regional lymph nodes of patients with cervical cancer who were treated surgically. Methods: Thirty-seven patients who underwent radical hysterectomy (Piver class III) with regional lymph node dissection for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB uterine cervical cancer were assessed for nodal HPV DNA status using polymerase chain reaction. Human papillomavirus DNA presence and types were analyzed in paraffin-embedded tissues from all primary tumors and 746 regional lymph nodes. The correlation between HPV DNA positivity of the lymph nodes and prognostic factors (stage at the time of diagnosis, status of the regional nodes, status of parametrial and surgical margins, tumor size, histological type, cervical stromal invasion depth, and lymphovascular space invasion was investigated. Results: Lymph node HPV DNA positivity increased in larger tumors (P Conclusions: Human papillomavirus DNA presence in the lymph nodes of patients with uterine cervical cancer may have an influence on disease survival and requires further research.

Pelvic exenterati- on has been the only treatment option providing a chance for cure in selected patients. The aim of this study is to analyze the effi- cacy of stereotactic body radiosurgery (SBRS) in patients with recurrent gynecological cancer. Sixteen patients treated with SBRS were analyzed retrospectively. The majority of the patients had cervical cancer. Eleven patients had a history of prior radiotherapy either as postoperative adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a median dose of 50.4 Gy (range 45-60 Gy) or definitive chemoradiotherapy as EBRT and high dose rate brachytherapy with a dose of 85-90 Gy low dose rate equivalent to point A. The prescribed dose of SBRS was 15-40 Gy (mean 26.6 Gy) in 3-5 fractions. Five patients with no prior radiotherapy received additional EBRT before SBRS. The median follow-up in all patients is 12 months (range 3-36 months). Six patients (37.5%) showed complete radiological and functional response to salvage SBRS. Six patients (37.5%) showed partial response and 2 (12.5%) showed stable disease. One and 2 year overall survival rates are 60.3% and 40.2% respectively. Progression free survival is 59%. All patients with complete response after SBRS are alive with no evidence of disease with a median follow up time of 20 months.

Secondary aims were 5-year overall survival (OS) and pattern of recurrence. <h3>Methodology</h3> International, multicenter, retrospective study from the Surveillance in Cervical CANcer (SCCAN) collaborative cohort. Patients with FIGO-2009 stage IB1-IIA1 who underwent open type B/C1/C2 radical hysterectomy according to Querleu-Morrow classification between 01/2007–12/2016, who did not undergo neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and who had negative lymph nodes and free surgical margins at final histology, were included. <h3>Results</h3> 1,257 patients were included. 883 (70.2%) underwent nerve sparing and 374 (29.8%) non-nerve sparing radical hysterectomy. 5-year-DFS in patients undergoing nerve sparing versus non-nerve sparing radical hysterectomy was 90.1% (95%CI:87.9–92.2) versus 93.8% (95%CI:91.1–96.5), p=0.047, respectively. Non-nerve sparing radical hysterectomy was independently associated with better DFS at multivariable analysis performed on the entire cohort (HR:0.50,95%CI:0.31–0.81;p=0.004). 5-year-OS was: nerve-sparing 95.7% (95%CI:94.1–97.2) versus non-nerve sparing 96.5% (95%CI:94.3–98.7), p=0.78. In patients with tumor diameter ≤20mm 5-year-DFS was 94.7% in nerve sparing versus 96.2% in non-nerve sparing (p=0.22). 5-year-DFS was 90.3% in non-nerve sparing radical hysterectomy compared with 83.1% in nerve sparing radical hysterectomy (p=0.016) in patients with tumors between 21–40mm (no significant difference in rate of adjuvant treatment in this subgroup, p=0.47). Significant DFS difference was confirmed after propensity match score analysis (balancing the two study groups). Pattern of recurrence in the propensity matched population did not demonstrate any difference (p=0.70). <h3>Conclusion</h3> For tumors ≤20mm no survival difference was found with more radical hysterectomy. For tumors between 21–40mm a more radical hysterectomy was associated with improved 5-year-DFS. No difference in pattern of recurrence according to extent of radicality was observed. Non-nerve sparing radical hysterectomy was associated with better 5-year-DFS compared with nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy after propensity score match analysis. <h3>Disclosures</h3> None",,,A113.1,A113,Medicine; Radical Hysterectomy; Cervical cancer; Stage (stratigraphy); Hysterectomy; Retrospective cohort study; Surgery; Nerve sparing; Cancer; Urology; Internal medicine; Prostatectomy; Prostate; Paleontology; Biology,,,,,https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/ijgc/33/Suppl_3/A113.1.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.232,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.232,,10.1136/ijgc-2023-esgo.232,,,0,,0,true,other-oa,hybrid

The randomized, open-label, phase 3 ENGOT-en9/LEAP-001 trial (NCT03884101) compares first-line lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced/recurrent EC. <h3>Methodology</h3> Eligible patients had stage III-IV or recurrent, radiographically apparent, EC with no prior chemotherapy (hormonal therapy and chemoradiation permitted) or disease progression (PD) ≥6 months after neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to lenvatinib 20 mg daily plus pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 Q3W plus carboplatin AUC 6 Q3W. Randomization was stratified by proficient versus deficient mismatch repair (MMR) status (pMMR versus dMMR), and in the pMMR stratum by prior adjuvant chemotherapy/chemoradiation (yes/no), measurable disease (yes/no), and ECOG performance status (0/1). Treatment continued for up to 35 cycles of pembrolizumab, 7 cycles of chemotherapy, or until PD/unacceptable toxicity. Dual primary endpoints were PFS (RECIST v1.1, blinded independent central review) and OS in the pMMR and intention-to-treat populations. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate and safety. Duration of response was an exploratory endpoint. <h3>Results</h3> Overall, 842 patients were randomized. At final analysis (data cutoff, October 2, 2023), after median follow-up of 38.4 (range, 30.3–52.9) months, OS was not statistically significant for non-inferiority of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in the pMMR population (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83–1.26]; non-inferiority P=0.2459875), thus no further statistical testing was performed (additional efficacy results in table 1). Treatment-related AEs occurred in 411/420 (97.9%) versus 398/411 (96.8%) treated patients in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy groups. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab did not meet the prespecified statistical criterion for OS or PFS versus chemotherapy in patients with pMMR advanced/recurrent EC in the first-line setting. The safety profile was manageable and consistent with that established for the combination in EC. <h3>Disclosures</h3> Disclosures provided.",,,,,Lenvatinib; Pembrolizumab; Oncology; Endometrial cancer; Medicine; Internal medicine; Chemotherapy; Cancer; Immunotherapy; Thyroid cancer,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2024-esgo.1115,,10.1136/ijgc-2024-esgo.1115,,,0,,5,false,,

Ultrasonographic evaluation were performed using a 3.5–6-MHz convex abdominal transducer and adequate software for performing elastographic examinations in quantitative acoustic radiation force impulse mode (Virtual Touch Quantification®). Every examination consisted of at least three independent shear wave velocity measurements. The mean shear wave velocity values were calculated, and used for statistical analysis. Postoperative pathology results of the lesions were used as the reference standard.Results: The mean shear wave velocity values were calculated as 2.79±1.03 m/s in cervical carcinomas, and as 1.86±0.62 m/s in control group. The mean shear wave velocity value of cervical carcinomas was significantly higher than the control group (p=0.003). The mean shear wave velocity values in squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinoma subtypes were calculated as 2.78±0.93 m/s, 3.16±1.46 m/s, and 1.90±0.21 m/s, respectively. There were no significant differences between cervical carcinoma subtypes in terms of their shear wave velocity values (p=0.247).Conclusion: Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging is a non-invasive and cost-effective, promising adjunct modality that enables objective quantitative measurement, which may contribute to the diagnosis of malignant cervical masses.",28,4,0733,0737,Adenosquamous carcinoma; Cervical cancer; Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging; Adenocarcinoma; Acoustic radiation force; Nuclear medicine; Cervical carcinoma; Squamous carcinoma; Impulse (physics); Medicine,,,,,https://annalsmedres.org/index.php/aomr/article/view/464,https://annalsmedres.org/index.php/aomr/article/view/464,,,3183560094,,0,,0,false,,

The high intermediate and high-risk patients were defined with respect to the 2016 ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO risk classification system and they were analyzed with respect to difference in survival rates.<bold>Results</bold>: Of the 2745 patients 1743 (63.5%) were operated by laparotomy, and the remaining were operated with laparoscopy. The total numbers of high intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer cases were 734 (45%) patients in the LT group and 307 (30.7%) patients in the LS group. Disease-free and overall survivals were not statistically different when compared between laparoscopy and laparotomy groups in terms of low, intermediate, high intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer.<bold>Conclusions</bold>: Regardless of the endometrial cancer risk category, long-term oncological outcomes of laparoscopic approach were found to be comparable to those treated with laparotomy. Our results are encouraging to consider laparoscopic surgery for high intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer cases.</p>",,,,,Endometrial cancer; Medicine; Laparotomy; Laparoscopy; Gynecologic oncology; Laparoscopic surgery; Surgery; Cancer; General surgery; Internal medicine,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-263938/latest.pdf https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-263938/v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-263938/v1,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-263938/v1,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,green

The cells of these tumors resemble endometrial cells in the proliferation stage, with many small plexiform arterioles. Herein we present a patient with endometrial stromal sarcoma that metastasized to the brain, along with the CT and MRI findings and a discussion of the surgical and histopathological features of the metastatic tumor. Immunohistopathological examination of the metastatic tumor showed a high mitotic rate and strong immunopositivity for CD10 and vimentin (as a mesenchymal marker); therefore, the lesion was considered to be high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Due to the rarity of reported cases of metastatic brain tumors of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, there isnâ€™t a standard treatment protocol; however, metastatic tumors of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma match the same general concepts of brain metastasis.

Methods We assessed the characteristics of 32 fellows, including the perceived adequacy of their fellowship training, the facilities of the clinics at which they were trained, and their levels of exposure and confidence in performing a total of 44 procedures. Exposure levels were performing, assisting with, observing, or no exposure. Confidence was assessed by asking whether they could perform each procedure. Correlation analysis was used to determine the link between exposure levels and confidence. Results The confidence of fellows to perform a surgical procedure increased with exposure to that procedure (r = 0.820, P 75%) had performed type 2 hysterectomy, total omentectomy, and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy.

The clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of 38 SMTs were analyzed, including ARID1A, SALL4, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), TP53, keratin 7, keratin 20, CEA, CDX2, WT1, PAX2, and PAX8. SMCs and SMBTs comprised 68.4% (n = 26) and 31.6% (n = 12) of all SMTs, respectively, studied. The mean age of diagnosis was 47.4 years and 41.4 years, and the mean size was 9 cm and 7.45 cm for SMC and SMBT, respectively. There was endometriosis or endometriotic cyst in 61.5% of SMCs and 50% of SMBTs. Immunohistochemically, loss of ARID1A staining was observed in 15 (65.2%) of 26 SMCs, and 3 (33.3%) of the 12 SMBTs. Only one SMC showed focal SALL4 positivity. All SMTs were positive for ER, PR, PAX8, and keratin 7. SMTs were negative for WT1, keratin 20, CDX2, and CEA (negative in 66.7% to 92.3% of the cases).

FIGO evre IB serviks kanseri olgularinda parametrektominin sinirlari ne olmalidir?,,2013,,,,,,Ali Ayhan; Polat Dursun; Asuman Nihan Haberal,"Objective: To demonstrate the histopathological basis of individually tailored less radical surgery concept in patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB cervical cancer. Material and Methods: The study was performed in the gynaecologic oncology department of Baskent School of Medicine Hospital, Ankara, Turkey between January 1 st 2008 and January 1 st 2009. Cardinal and uterosacral ligaments were serially sectioned in an alternative approach, and were examined by a senior gynaecologic pathologist. Clinical and pathological features and findings in sections of uterine ligaments were recorded. Study data were analysed using the SPSS 17.0 program. Results: Thirty-two out of 38 cases had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (84.2 %), and six had non-squamous cell tumours (15.8%). Four cases had microscopic (10.5 %) and one case had macroscopic (2.6 %) tumour extension in cardinal ligaments. Mean tumour-free cardinal ligament length was 16.8±7.39 mm. Presence of tumour invasion in cardinal ligaments correlated significantly with pelvic lymph node metastasis (p=0.02). No isolated tumour deposits were found in any of the cases in serial sections of the cardinal or uterosacral ligaments. Conclusion: This research was designed as a preliminary study. Future studies are needed to determine the optimal resection margins of the uterine ligaments in surgically treated stage IB cervical cancer. With continuing research and the development of newer surgical techniques, patients’ quality of life will be optimised accordingly.

Kaya; Adrian Loghin; Ali Ayhan; H. F. Nied,"The analysis of two and three dimensional fracture mechanics problems in anisotropic materials using ANSYS finite element software and 3DFAS (Three Dimensional Fracture Analysis System) is examined in this study. The methodology uses analytically derived generalized plane strain crack tip fields in anisotropic materials and is implemented into an ANSYS Macro using ANSYS Parametric Design Language. It is shown that quarter-point finite element approach is still a very effective technique for general three dimensional crack problems in homogeneous anisotropic materials. The expressions of the crack tip asymptotic displacement field are summarized and numerical examples of two and three dimensional crack problems in orthotropic, directionally solidified, and single crystal materials are presented. The stress intensity factors are compared with two-dimensional analytical and numerical solutions available in the literature and with numerical solutions obtained from FRAC3D [1, 2], a three dimensional fracture analysis program using enriched finite elements. Very good agreement is obtained between the different numerical techniques or with the analytical solutions.Copyright © 2006 by ASME",,,569,579,Orthotropic material; Finite element method; Materials science; Plane stress; Displacement field; Fracture (geology); Stress intensity factor; Fracture mechanics; Structural engineering; Stress (mechanics),,,,,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings/IMECE2006/47667/569/318746 https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1602601 https://journals.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings/IMECE2006/47667/569/318746 http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1602601,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/imece2006-15539,,10.1115/imece2006-15539,2042498666,,0,002-237-036-082-879; 017-897-238-201-264; 024-751-272-668-29X; 026-430-055-449-803; 042-680-819-450-049; 044-935-410-482-525; 064-465-560-111-553; 067-774-454-898-557; 080-447-116-887-09X; 095-094-300-933-264; 140-499-144-907-253; 154-343-406-557-503; 163-699-166-644-694; 186-193-153-918-349; 193-057-165-805-840,6,false,,
